a
winner
two
weeks

New

MMEND
for
his

served
for

match
at

in

third
set
before

Washington
MMEND
came
charging
back
.
*NL*
"

yourself
the

chance

win

keep
battling

maybe
something
will
happen

"
said
the
26-year-old

,
ranked
65th
.
*NL*
"
I
kept
my
composure

I
was
proud
of
myself

that

usually
I
would
have
folded
up

gone

*NL*
The
hard-serving
O'Brien
,
a
former
MMSTART_3434750	United_States

collegiate
national
champion
,
fired
up
17
aces
to
ultimately
subdue
the
never-say-die
MMSTART_873616	MaliVai_Washington

*NL*
The
fifth

MMEND
,
after
saving
one
break
point
with
a
forehand

down

netted

O'Brien
a
4-2

*NL*
The
Texan
blasted
in
two
aces

at
5-2

then
converted
his
eighth

for
victory
when

found
the
net

another
backhand

him
a

fine
and
suspension

24

with

on

*NL*
A
boisterous
cheering
section
backed
the
distracted
Chilean

booed
the
lanky
American

who
ate
up
all
the
attention

I

The
match
turned
on
the
third-set
tiebreaker

which
the
American
won
7-5
much
to
the
dismay
of
the
spectators

*NL*
"
I

"
I

I
play

that
's
why
I
play
at
night

*NL*
I

*NL*
At

sarcastic

jiggled
his

At

Consumer
spending
barely
edged
up
in
July
,
the
MMSTART_70243	United_States_Department_of_Commerce
Commerce
Department
MMEND
said
Friday
,
as
income
growth
slowed
abruptly
to
the
weakest
pace
in
six
months
.
*NL*
Spending
rose
0.2
percent
to
a
seasonally
adjusted
annual
rate
of
$
5.15
trillion
after
dropping
a
revised
0.4
percent
in
June
.
*NL*
Incomes
from
wages
,
salaries
and
all
other
sources
gained
0.1
percent
to
a
rate
of
$
6.47
trillion
after
a
0.9
percent
jump
in
June
.
*NL*
Department
officials
said
July
's
slight
gain
in
incomes
was
the
weakest
for
any
month
since
January
,
when
they
were
flat
.
*NL*
Wages
and
salaries
came
under
pressure
in
July
as
a
shorter
average
workweek
and
lower
hourly
earnings
cut
into
paychecks
.
*NL*
The
department
said
wages
and
salaries
decreased
by
$
6.9
billion
in
July
after
climbing
$
45
billion
in
June
.
*NL*
"
In
July
,
average
weekly
hours

more

offsetting
the
effect
of
an

,
"
MMSTART_70243	United_States_Department_of_Commerce
Commerce
MMEND
said
.
*NL*
But
more
money
went
into
savings
accounts
,
as
savings
held
at
5.3
cents
out
of
each
dollar
earned
in
both
June
and
July
.
*NL*
That
was
the
highest
savings
rate
since
October
last
year
,
when
5.5
cents
out
of
each
dollar
earned
was
being
saved
.
*NL*
The
generally
lackluster
report
on
spending
and
incomes
in
July
had
been
expected
.
*NL*
At
the

time
,
the

said
in
a
separate

that
new

received
by
MMSTART_3434750	United_States
U.S.
MMEND
factories
climbed
strongly
in

with
widespread
gains
across
most
major
categories
.
*NL*
Orders
increased
1.8
percent
to
a
seasonally
adjusted
$
317.6
billion
,
significantly
stronger
than
the
1
percent
rise
forecast
by
MMSTART_21560	New_York_Stock_Exchange
Wall

MMEND
economists
.
*NL*
That
followed
a
revised
0.7
percent
decline
in

orders
.
*NL*
Commerce
said
previously
that
spending
at
retail
stores
was
up
only
0.1
percent
in
July
,
partly
because
of
softer
sales
of
new
cars
and
light
trucks
.
*NL*
In
addition
,
the
Labour
Department
's
July
employment
report
had
foreshadowed
the
muted
income
growth
.
*NL*
It
showed
average
hourly
earnings
fell
in
July
by
0.2
percent
to
$
11.00
and
the
average
workweek
shortened
to
34.3
hours
from
34.7
in

.

income
,
which
includes
wages
and

as
well
as
income
from

such
as

and

,
are
essential
for
funding
consumer
purchases
,
which
fuel
two-thirds
of
national
economic
activity
.
*NL*
Spending
on
all
types
of
durable
goods
,
which
includes
cars
,
fell
to
an
annual
rate
of
$
626.3
