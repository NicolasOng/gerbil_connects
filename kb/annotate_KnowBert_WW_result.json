LONDON 1996-08-30 West Indian all-rounder Phil Simmons took four for 38 on Friday as Leicestershire beat Somerset by an innings and 39 runs in two days to take over at the head of the county championship. Their stay on top, though, may be short-lived as title rivals Essex, Derbyshire and Surrey all closed in on victory while Kent made up for lost time in their rain-affected match against Nottinghamshire. After bowling Somerset out for 83 on the opening morning at Grace Road, Leicestershire extended their first innings by 94 runs before being bowled out for 296 with England discard Andy Caddick taking three for 83. Trailing by 213, Somerset got a solid start to their second innings before Simmons stepped in to bundle them out for 174. Essex, however, look certain to regain their top spot after Nasser Hussain and Peter Such gave them a firm grip on their match against Yorkshire at Headingley. Hussain, considered surplus to England's one-day requirements, struck 158, his first championship century of the season, as Essex reached 372 and took a first innings lead of 82. By the close Yorkshire had turned that into a 37-run advantage but off-spinner Such had scuttled their hopes, taking four for 24 in 48 balls and leaving them hanging on 119 for five and praying for rain. At the Oval, Surrey captain Chris Lewis, another man dumped by England, continued to silence his critics as he followed his four for 45 on Thursday with 80 not out on Friday in the match against Warwickshire. He was well backed by England hopeful Mark Butcher who made 70 as Surrey closed on 429 for seven, a lead of 234. Derbyshire kept up the hunt for their first championship title since 1936 by reducing Worcestershire to 133 for five in their second innings, still 100 runs away from avoiding an innings defeat. Australian Tom Moody took six for 82 but Chris Adams, 123, and Tim O'Gorman, 109, took Derbyshire to 471 and a first innings lead of 233. After the frustration of seeing the opening day of their match badly affected by the weather, Kent stepped up a gear to dismiss Nottinghamshire for 214. They were held up by a gritty 84 from Paul Johnson but ex-England fast bowler Martin McCague took four for 55. By stumps Kent had reached 108 for three.", "value": [{"start": 10, "end": 24, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicestershire_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 65, "end": 71, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London"}, {"start": 83, "end": 94, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team"}, {"start": 107, "end": 119, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Simmons"}, {"start": 150, "end": 164, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicestershire_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 170, "end": 178, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 339, "end": 349, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derbyshire_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 354, "end": 360, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 392, "end": 396, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 456, "end": 472, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottinghamshire_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 487, "end": 495, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 545, "end": 559, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicestershire_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 637, "end": 644, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team"}, {"start": 653, "end": 665, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Caddick"}, {"start": 704, "end": 712, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 869, "end": 883, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasser_Hussain"}, {"start": 888, "end": 898, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Such"}, {"start": 944, "end": 953, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 957, "end": 968, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headingley"}, {"start": 1093, "end": 1098, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 1161, "end": 1170, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 1365, "end": 1371, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 1547, "end": 1560, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwickshire_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 1599, "end": 1611, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Butcher"}, {"start": 1627, "end": 1633, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 1674, "end": 1684, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derbyshire_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 1760, "end": 1774, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcestershire_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 1880, "end": 1889, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Moody"}, {"start": 1956, "end": 1966, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derbyshire_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 2101, "end": 2105, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 2135, "end": 2150, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottinghamshire_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 2238, "end": 2252, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_McCague"}, {"start": 2281, "end": 2285, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_County_Cricket_Club"}]}, {"text": "SOCCER - JAPAN GET LUCKY WIN, CHINA IN SURPRISE DEFEAT. Nadim Ladki AL-AIN, United Arab Emirates 1996-12-06 Japan began the defence of their Asian Cup title with a lucky 2-1 win against Syria in a Group C championship match on Friday. But China saw their luck desert them in the second match of the group, crashing to a surprise 2-0 defeat to newcomers Uzbekistan. China controlled most of the match and saw several chances missed until the 78th minute when Uzbek striker Igor Shkvyrin took advantage of a misdirected defensive header to lob the ball over the advancing Chinese keeper and into an empty net. Oleg Shatskiku made sure of the win in injury time, hitting an unstoppable left foot shot from just outside the area. The former Soviet republic was playing in an Asian Cup finals tie for the first time. Despite winning the Asian Games title two years ago, Uzbekistan are in the finals as outsiders. Two goals from defensive errors in the last six minutes allowed Japan to come from behind and collect all three points from their opening meeting against Syria. Takuya Takagi scored the winner in the 88th minute, rising to head a Hiroshige Yanagimoto cross towards the Syrian goal which goalkeeper Salem Bitar appeared to have covered but then allowed to slip into the net. It was the second costly blunder by Syria in four minutes. Defender Hassan Abbas rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of Bitar's goal. Nader Jokhadar had given Syria the lead with a well-struck header in the seventh minute. Japan then laid siege to the Syrian penalty area for most of the game but rarely breached the Syrian defence. Bitar pulled off fine saves whenever they did. Japan coach Shu Kamo said : ' ' The Syrian own goal proved lucky for us. The Syrians scored early and then played defensively and adopted long balls which made it hard for us. ' ' Japan, co-hosts of the World Cup in 2002 and ranked 20th in the world by FIFA, are favourites to regain their title here.

Duran, 45, takes on little-known Mexican Ariel Cruz, 30, in a super middleweight non-title bout in Panama City. The fight, Duran's first on home soil for 10 years, is being billed here as the \"Return of the Legend\" and Duran still talks as if he was in his prime. \"I want a fifth title. This match is to prepare me. I feel good. I'm not retiring,\" Duran told Reuters. But those close to the boxer acknowledge that the man who has won championships in four different weight classes-- lightweight, welterweight, junior middleweight and middleweight-- is drawing close to the end of his career. \"Each time he fights, he's on the last frontier of his career. If he loses Saturday, it could devalue his position as one of the world's great boxers,\" Panamanian Boxing Association President Ramon Manzanares said.

Little has opted not to risk aggravating the knee injury which ruled him out of a large chunk of the tour and is replaced by fellow Queenslander Daniel Herbert. Owen Finegan has recovered from the knocks he took in last weekend's test against Wales and retains his place in the back-row ahead of Daniel Manu. The Wallabies have their sights set on a 13th successive victory to end their European tour with a 100 percent record but also want to turn on the style and provide David Campese with a fitting send-off in his final match in Australian colours. The Wallabies currently have no plans to make any special presentation to the 34-year-old winger but a full house of 75,000 spectators will still gather in the hope of witnessing one last moment of magic. Campese will be up against a familiar foe in the shape of Barbarians captain Rob Andrew, the man who kicked Australia to defeat with a last-ditch drop-goal in the World Cup quarter-final in Cape Town. \"Campo has a massive following in this country and has had the public with him ever since he first played here in 1984,\" said Andrew, also likely to be making his final Twickenham appearance. On tour, Australia have won all four tests against Italy, Scotland, Ireland and Wales, and scored 414 points at an average of almost 35 points a game. League duties restricted the Barbarians ' selectorial options but they still boast 13 internationals including England full-back Tim Stimpson and recalled wing Tony Underwood, plus All Black forwards Ian Jones and Norm Hewitt.

Larry Fine NEW YORK 1996-08-30 Andre Agassi escaped disaster on Thursday but Wimbledon finalist MaliVai Washington and Marcelo Rios were not so fortunate on a night of upsets at the U.S. Open. The 11th-seeded Washington fell short of reprising his Wimbledon miracle comeback as he lost to red-hot wildcard Alex O'Brien 6-3 6-4 5-7 3-6 6-3 in a two hour 51 minute struggle on the Stadium court. Next door on the grandstand, 10th seed Rios lost to another player with a Wimbledon connection-- bad boy Jeff Tarango. The temperamental left-hander defeated the Chilean 6-4 4-6 7-6 6-2. The day programme went smoothly although sixth-seeded former champion Agassi had to wriggle out of a dangerous 3-6 0-4 hole, winning 18 of the last 19 games against India's Leander Paes. But the night belonged to the upstarts. Washington, who climbed back from a 1-5 deficit, two sets down in the third set against Todd Martin in the Wimbledon semifinals, looked poised for another sensational comeback. O'Brien, a winner two weeks ago in New Haven for his first pro title, served for the match at 5-4 in the third set before Washington came charging back. \"I just kept saying to myself, ' keep giving yourself the best chance to win, keep battling, maybe something will happen, '\" said the 26-year-old O'Brien, ranked 65th. \"I kept my composure and I was proud of myself for that-- usually I would have folded up the tent and gone home.\" The hard-serving O'Brien, a former U.S. collegiate national champion, fired up 17 aces to ultimately subdue the never-say-die Washington. The fifth set stayed on serve until the sixth game, when Washington, after saving one break point with a forehand winner down the line, netted a backhand to give O'Brien a 4-2 lead. The Texan blasted in two aces to hold serve at 5-2 and then converted his eighth match point for victory when Washington found the net with another backhand from 40-0. \"You just kind of keep fighting and you keep trying to make him play a little bit. I think he got a little tight at a couple of moments,\" said Washington. \"But I think he served pretty well when he had to.\" Tarango, whose Wimbledon tantrum two years ago brought him a $ 28,000 fine and suspension from this year's tournament at the All-England Club, argued calls and taunted fans in his lively two hour, 24 minute tango with Rios on the grandstand. A boisterous cheering section backed the distracted Chilean and booed the lanky American, who ate up all the attention. \"I'm an emotional player,\" said the 104th-ranked Tarango. \"I think I played very well tonight, very focused.\" The match turned on the third-set tiebreaker, which the American won 7-5 much to the dismay of the spectators. \"I love the crowd if they boo me every day. It fires me up, makes me play my best tennis,\" Tarango said. \"I played some of my best tennis in college when fraternities were throwing beer on me. If tennis was like that every day, I think everybody wold be having a lot more fun.\" Rios did not appreciate Tarango's antics. \"He's always complaining too much,\" said Rios. \"But I think it's not that. I think I played really bad. It was tough to play at night. Balls were going really fast. I lost too many points that I never lose. I did n't play my tennis.\" \"I do n't see the ball like I see during the day. I play an American so that's why I play at night. I did n't feel good on the court.\" At the end of the match, Tarango blew sarcastic kisses to the crowd, then jiggled his body to a Rios rooting section in a jeering salute. \"I support their enthusiasm,\" Tarango said about the fans. \"At the same time, they're cheering blatantly against me. After I won I figured I could give them a little razzle-dazzle.\"", "value": [{"start": 94, "end": 106, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi"}, {"start": 140, "end": 149, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Championships,_Wimbledon"}, {"start": 159, "end": 177, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MaliVai_Washington"}, {"start": 182, "end": 194, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_R\u00edos"}, {"start": 311, "end": 320, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Championships,_Wimbledon"}, {"start": 496, "end": 500, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_R\u00edos"}, {"start": 531, "end": 540, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Championships,_Wimbledon"}, {"start": 619, "end": 626, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile"}, {"start": 714, "end": 720, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Agassi"}, {"start": 959, "end": 970, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Martin"}, {"start": 978, "end": 987, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Championships,_Wimbledon"}, {"start": 1083, "end": 1092, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Haven,_Connecticut"}, {"start": 1518, "end": 1522, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 2193, "end": 2202, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Championships,_Wimbledon"}, {"start": 2396, "end": 2400, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_R\u00edos"}, {"start": 2472, "end": 2479, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile"}, {"start": 2706, "end": 2714, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 2852, "end": 2859, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Tarango"}, {"start": 3039, "end": 3043, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcelo_R\u00edos"}, {"start": 3375, "end": 3383, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 3475, "end": 3482, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Tarango"}, {"start": 3618, "end": 3625, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Tarango"}]}, {"text": "CRICKET - LARA ENDURES ANOTHER MISERABLE DAY. Robert Galvin MELBOURNE 1996-12-06 Australia gave Brian Lara another reason to be miserable when they beat West Indies by five wickets in the opening World Series limited overs match on Friday. Lara, disciplined for misconduct on Wednesday, was dismissed for five to extend a disappointing run of form on tour. Australia, who hold a 2-0 lead in the five-match test series, overhauled West Indies ' total of 172 all out with eight balls to spare to end a run of six successive one-day defeats. All-rounder Greg Blewett steered his side to a comfortable victory with an unbeaten 57 in 90 balls to the delight of the 42,442 crowd. Man-of-the match Blewett came to the wicket with the total on 70 for two and hit three fours during an untroubled innings lasting 129 minutes. His crucial fifth-wicket partnership with fellow all-rounder Stuart Law, who scored 21, added 71 off 85 balls. Lara looked out of touch during his brief stay at the crease before chipping a simple catch to Shane Warne at mid-wicket. West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd has apologised for Lara's behaviour on Tuesday. He (Lara) had told Australia coach Geoff Marsh that wicketkeeper Ian Healy was unwelcome in the visitors ' dressing room. The Melbourne crowd were clearly angered by the incident, loudly jeering the West Indies vice-captain as he walked to the middle.

Henke stood two strokes ahead of Bob Estes and three up on Billy Andrade, Duffy Waldorf and Jesper Parnevik. Woods, who turned pro Tuesday after winning an unprecedented third successive U.S. Amateur Championship, almost eagled the 18th hole. He settled for a birdie and a four-under opening round that left him five shots off the pace. \"Yesterday was the toughest day I've had for a long time,\" Woods said. \"Today, I got to play golf.\" He added : \"I thought I got off off to a great start. It was a perfect start. I'm in a good position.\" Henke, who called his round a \"pleasant surprise,\" finished with six birdies on the final eight holes. \"We finally got things going in the right direction,\" he said. \"It was my best round in a very long time.

MELBOURNE 1996-12-06 West Indies batsman Brian Lara suffered another blow to his Australian tour, after already being disciplined for misconduct, when he was dismissed cheaply in the first limited overs match against Australia on Friday. Lara, who earned a stern rebuke from his own tour management after an angry outburst against Australia wicketkeeper Ian Healy, scored five to prolong a run of poor form with the bat. The West Indies vice-captain struggled for timing during his 36-minute stay at the crease before chipping a ball from medium pacer Tom Moody straight to Shane Warne at mid-wicket. West Indies were 53 for two in 15 overs when rain stopped play at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after captain Courtney Walsh won the toss and elected to bat. Lara's outburst three days ago has clearly turned some of the Australian public against him. As he walked to the wicket he was greeted by loud jeers from sections of the crowd. On several occasions during his innings, the crowd joined together in a series of obscene chants against him. Tour manager Clive Lloyd on Wednesday apologised for Lara's behaviour in confronting Australia coach Geoff Marsh in the opposition dressing room to protest against his dismissal in the second test on Tuesday. Lloyd did not say what form the discipline would take. Lara, who holds the record for the highest score in test and first-class cricket, was unhappy about Healy's role in the incident and questioned whether the ball had carried to the Australia keeper. Australia went on to win the match at the Sydney Cricket Ground by 124 runs to take a two-nil lead in the five-test series after Lara failed in both innings. Lara has yet to score a century since West Indies arrived in Australia five weeks ago. Both West Indies and Australia team management have played down the incident, stressing that relations between the two sides have not been adversely affected.

GENEVA 1996-08-30 UEFA came down heavily on Belgian club Standard Liege on Friday for \"disgraceful behaviour\" in an Intertoto final match against Karlsruhe of Germany. The Belgian club were fined 25,000 Swiss francs ($ 20,850) for unsporting conduct and captain Guy Hellers banned for seven games. He was sent off for insulting the referee and then urged his team mates to protest.

BUCHAREST 1996-08-30 Romanian listed state engineer Comelf said it almost doubled six-month output, with net profit rising by 33 percent to 1.069 billion lei. But the company complained inflation and the artificially high rate of the leu cut profit margins on exports, keeping profits well below its forecast of 1.4 billion lei. Comelf's six-month output rose to 4,378 tonnes of equipment from 2,684 tonnes in the equivalent period in 1995, the company report to the Bucharest stock exchange showed. Comelf, based in the central Transylvanian town of Bistrita, manufactures water purification equipment, machinery for the thermal power sector and other equipment. \"In the first six months of 1996 we concentrated on increasing the volume of our output and exports in particular and improving the quality of our products,\" the report said. From January to June Comelf exported 59 percent of its output, up from 37.3 percent in the same period last year. The company said higher than anticipated inflation and rising raw materials and wage costs also hit profits. Year-on-year inflation, initially estimated at 20 percent in December, was 33.8 percent in June, higher than a revised end-year forecast of 30 percent. The 12 month figure quickened to 40.3 percent in July. The leu currency has slipped only gradually this year, and is currently quoted at an official rate of 3,162 to the dollar, well below the 3,550 retail price that exporters say is more realistic.-- Luli Popescu, Bucharest Newsroom 40-1 3120264", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 7, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania"}, {"start": 44, "end": 53, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest"}, {"start": 65, "end": 73, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania"}, {"start": 278, "end": 281, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_leu"}, {"start": 511, "end": 520, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest"}, {"start": 1524, "end": 1533, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest"}]}, {"text": "NCAA AMERICAN FOOTBALL-OHIO STATE'S PACE FIRST REPEAT LOMBARDI AWARD WINNER.

Pace, a junior, helped Ohio State to a 10-1 record and a berth in the Rose Bowl against Arizona State. He was the most dominant offensive lineman in the country and also played defensive line in goal-line situations.

CHICAGO 1996-08-30 U.S. debt futures finished a shortened pre-holiday session sharply lower, as the markets were shaken by a stronger than expected rise in the August National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) index for the Chicago area, traders and analysts said. The August Chicago NAPM rose 8.8 points to 60.0, its highest level since 62.6 in February 1995 and the largest monthly rise since December 1993. Primary dealers immediately sold Eurodollar and bond futures, after the market on average was expecting the index to rise marginally to 51.9 from July's 51.2. Traders also said Japanese investors were unwinding long Eurodollar futures / short swaps, and that heavy put buying helped pressure Eurodollars to lower levels before the close. One U.S. firm bought 35,000 September 97 mid-curve put options at a strike price of 93.25 to 93.30 in the last two sessions, while a French firm bought 4,000 September 93.30 to 93.32 put spreads. \"Even before the data came out, we were seeing put buying,\" one floor trader said. Meanwhile, funds were reportedly good sellers of five-year notes. Rumors circulated that the Federal Reserve was buying five-year notes, and that a renowned hedge fund manager was buying 10-year notes in the cash markets. However, December T-bonds ended below a major trendline level at 106-26/32, as the yield in the cash bond market set its highest monthly close since April 1995 at 7.12 percent, one analyst said. December bonds blew through the July 30 low of 107-06/32, even though conditions were slightly oversold, traders said. The December calendar spread continued to widen, also reflecting the market's fear of rising inflation. While the market continues to price-in higher U.S. interest rates, there was little conviction to the theory that the Federal Reserve would tighten rates before the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on September 24. Federal Reserve governor Lawrence Lindsey, speaking on U.S. cable television network CNBC, said the U.S. economy appears on balance to be a bit strong, adding the central bank would not curb growth provided inflation remains in check. Earlier in the day, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan said at the annual Jackson Hole symposium that the goal of price stability is within reach for major nations. Traders said the Fed's decision to adopt a tightening bias at the July FOMC meeting has cast more focus on every piece of U.S. economic news. \"The Fed's stance has really sensitized us to all this data,\" one analyst said. \"The revisions to GDP, for example, may not have attracted a lot of attention.\" At the end of pit trade, December bonds were off 27/32 at 106-25/32, 10-year notes down 21/32 at 105-17/32, munibonds off 17/32 at 111-20/32, December Eurodollars were down 11 bps at 93.94, March Eurodollars were off 13 bps at 93.72 and March T-bills were down 12 bps at 94.33.", "value": [{"start": 39, "end": 46, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"}, {"start": 53, "end": 60, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"}, {"start": 287, "end": 294, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"}, {"start": 339, "end": 346, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"}, {"start": 506, "end": 516, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurodollar"}, {"start": 650, "end": 658, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"}, {"start": 815, "end": 819, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 944, "end": 950, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"start": 1183, "end": 1198, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System"}, {"start": 1776, "end": 1780, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1848, "end": 1863, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System"}, {"start": 1955, "end": 1970, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System"}, {"start": 2210, "end": 2213, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System"}, {"start": 2223, "end": 2237, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Greenspan"}, {"start": 2257, "end": 2269, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Hole"}, {"start": 2470, "end": 2474, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}]}, {"text": "SOCCER - FRENCH LEAGUE STANDINGS.

FARMINGTON HILLS, Mich. 1996-08-30 Shares of Douglas & Lomason Co were up 4-1/2 at 30-5/8 Friday afternoon after Thursday's announcement that the vehicle seat maker had agreed to be acquired by Magna International Inc for $ 31 a share, or $ 135 million. Magna was up 1/8 to 48-1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. Douglas & Lomason has 4.45 million common shares outstanding, some of which are option shares to be purchased at exercise prices less than the $ 31 offered price. The acquisition will beef up Markham, Ontario-based Magna's North American car and truck seating business, allowing it to better compete with Johnson Controls Inc and Lear Corp. Family-controlled Douglas & Lomason, which had 1995 revenue of $ 561 million, was finding it more difficult to compete for new seating contracts from vehicle makers, said James Hoey, chief financial officer. \"Unfortunately, in the auto industry these days, a $ 500 million company is not a big company anymore,\" Hoey said. \"This merger makes us much more competitive.\" He added that Douglas & Lomason's top executives have been asked to stay on with Magna after the merger, though their future roles have not yet been defined. Douglas & Lomason's profits were hurt in the past year by model changeovers, which had reduced production at some important customers, but are now recovering, analysts said. The company earned $ 11.2 million on sales of $ 299 million in the first six months of 1996, up from year-earlier earnings of $ 4.7 million on sales of $ 285.7 million. Ford plans to cut its roster of 2,300 tier-one suppliers-- those it deals with directly-- in half over the next five years. \"The deal really levels the seating field somewhat,\" said John Casesa of Schroder Wertheim & Co. \"It should give Magna the critical mass to be a bigger player in that market.\" Magna's traditional strength has been instrument panels, door panels and other interior components. Magna, Johnson Controls and Lear have been working to build up their capabilties to supply complete interiors to automakers, including seats, instrument panels, door panels carpeting and headliners.", "value": [{"start": 583, "end": 591, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1007, "end": 1011, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_R._Hoey"}, {"start": 1565, "end": 1569, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company"}]}, {"text": "SOCCER - FRENCH LEAGUE RESULTS.

LONDON 1996-08-30 This is how major world bond markets were trading in late European business on Friday. GERMANY - Bunds extended losses, flirting with session lows after falling victim to sharply higher U.S. economic data which revived fears that interest rates may soon turn higher. The September Bund future on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) was trading at 97.18, down 0.20 from Thursday's settlement price. BRITAIN - Gilts struggled off the day's lows but ended 10/32 down on the day. A sharp plunge in U.S. Treasuries after a shock rise in the Chicago PMI pulled gilts lower, but traders said the market was nervous anyway ahead of August MO data and the PMI survey due on Monday. The September long gilt future on LIFFE was trading at 107-2/32, down 8/32 from Thursday's settlement price. FRANCE - Bond and PIBOR futures ended the day higher despite much stronger than expected U.S. data. The September notional bond future on the MATIF in Paris settled at 123.14, up 0.04 from Thursday's settlement price. ITALY - Bond futures held to easier levels in late afternoon after the sharp drop in Treasuries, but a resilient lira helped limit BTP losses. The September bond future on LIFFE was trading at 115.45, down 0.13 from Thursday's settlement price. UNITED STATES - Prices of U.S. Treasury securities were trading sharply lower near midday after a surprisingly strong Chicago Purchasing Managers ' report shook the markets ahead of the long Labour Day weekend. The September Treasury bond future on the Chicago Board of Trade was trading at 107-11/32, down 26/32 from Thursday's settlement price. The long bond was quoted to yield 7.12 percent. JAPAN - Yield for benchmark 182nd cash bond fell on buy-backs following weaker-than-expected industrial output data, which convinced traders the BOJ would not raise interest rates soon. Japanese Goverment Bonds futures which closed before the output data, lost much of day's gains as Tokyo stock prices recovered from the day's low.In after hours trading the September future on LIFFE was trading at 122.53, up 0.26 from Thursday's settlement price on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. EUROBONDS - Primary market activity was sharply lower, as players wound down ahead of Monday's U.S. Labour Day holiday and next week's U.S. employment data. NSW Treasury launched a A$ 100 million three-year discount bond aimed at Japanese investors. DNIB issued a 275 million Norwegian crown bond, which was pre-placed with a European institution. DNIB also set a 110 million guilder step-up bond.

The Briton, who lost his World Boxing Council (WBC) title to Mike Tyson in March, said : \"I was in shock as soon as he told me and it still has n't really sunk in.\" I never wanted to end like this but at the end of the day I'm glad I had a good innings. \"Bruno, for years one of Britain's most popular sportsmen, had hoped to have another shot at the world title and had been in training until a routine eye test on Monday highlighted a problem with his right eye. Professor David McLeod, who examined Bruno, told the Sun :\" There is a risk he could be blinded in the eye if he steps into the ring again. He is in danger of getting a retinal detachment and there is no point in exposing himself to that. \"Bruno lost three world title fights before finally landing the crown by beating American Oliver McCall in a unanimous points decision at Wembley in September 1995. He was only the third Briton ever to hold a world heavyweight title. But Bruno lost the title on his first defence when he fought American Tyson in Las Vegas.

Lebed said on Friday he hoped to sign a document with the rebels later in the day which would deal with the political settlement of the conflict. Moscow, which wants to keep Chechnya as a part of the Russian Federation, sent troops to the region in December 1994 to quell its independence bid. Yeltsin has said any deal should preserve Russia's territorial integrity. Itar-Tass news agency quoted Lebed as saying that he would suggest to the rebels that the decision on Chechnya's future political status be deferred by up to 10 years. Lebed said he had a telephone conversation with Yeltsin late on Thursday but gave no details. Yeltsin's press office could not confirm the call.

ROME 1996-12-06 Italian Serie A games to be played on Sunday (league positions in parentheses, all kick- off times GMT) : Bologna (4) v Piacenza (13) 1330 Along with leaders Vicenza, fourth-placed Bologna represent the biggest surprise of this Italian autumn. Led as usual by Swede Kennet Andersson and Russian Igor Kolyvanov in attack, Bologna can expect a tough home match against a Piacenza side still exultant after a 3-2 league win over AC Milan last Sunday. Cagliari (16) v Reggiana (18) 1530 Cagliari start favourite in this relegation scrap following draws with Napoli and Inter in last two outings but will be without suspended Swiss defender Ramon Vega. Bottom team Reggiana are also without a suspended defender, German Dietmar Beiersdorfer. Fiorentina (10) v Perugia (8) 1330 Fiorentina will be without three suspended players-- defenders Daniele Carnasciali and Lorenzo Amoruso and midfielder Emiliano Bigica-- for a difficult home match against unpredictable, attack-oriented Perugia led by in-form Croat striker Milan Rapajic and the experienced Fausto Pizzi. Lazio (12) v AS Roma (7) 1930 Poor man's Roman derby in what has been a miserable season for both Rome teams, already eliminated from the Italian and UEFA Cups. Lazio have injury doubts about striker Pierluigi Casiraghi, Czech midfielder Pavel Nedved and defender Paolo Negro, while Roma present a full strength side led by Argentine Abel Balbo, Marco Delvecchio and Francesco Totti in attack. AC Milan (9) v Udinese (11) 1330 Can Milan sink any further? Following their midweek Champions ' League elimination by Norwegian side Rosenborg, a morale-boosting win is badly needed. Liberian striker George Weah makes a welcome return for Milan alongside Roberto Baggio, with Montenegrin Dejan Savicevic in midfield. Good news for Milan is that Udinese's German striker Oliver Bierhoff is out through injury. Napoli (5) v Verona (17) 1330 In-form Napoli should prove too strong for second from bottom Verona despite the absence of their suspended Argentine defender Roberto Ayala. Verona's slim chances have been further reduced by a knee injury to their experienced midfielder Eugenio Corini. Parma (14) v Atlalanta (15) 1330 Parma may field new signing, Croat midfielder Mario Stanic, in an attempt to lift a miserable season which has seen them go without a win since a 1-0 triumph over Cagliari eight weeks ago. Parma's French midfielder Daniel Bravo and defender Fabio Cannavaro are suspended while Argentine Nestor Sensini is out through injury. Atalanta look to Filippo Inzaghi, scorer of eight goals. Sampdoria (6) v Juventus (3) 1330 All-conquering Juventus field their most recent signing, Portuguese defender Dimas, while Alessandro Del Piero and Croat Alen Boksic lead the attack. The new world club champions may prove too strong for a Sampdoria side led by captain Roberto Mancini but missing injured French midfielder Pierre Laigle. Vicenza (1) v Internazionale (2) 1330 Not exactly a clash of the titans but an intriuguing match nonetheless. Full strength Vicenza, led by Uruguayan Marcelo Otero, may continue their surprise run at the top against an Inter side that has been less than impressive in three successive home draws.

The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) postponed municipal elections as a result of the irregularities but decided to proceed with voting for higher offices.

Larisa Sayenko MINSK 1996-08-30 A senior Belarus politician accused President Alexander Lukashenko on Friday of attempting to set up a dictatorship in the former Soviet republic. The speaker of the Belarus parliament, Semyon Sharetsky, told Reuters that a draft constitution, due to be put to a national referendum on November 7, would dangerously increase the powers of the ruler. \"The world community should not be indifferent to the fact that President Lukashenko, who leads this European state of 10 million people, is trying to establish a dictatorship with his new constitution,\" Sharetsky said. The new constitution calls for a two-chamber parliament with a 110-seat majority-elected house of representatives and a regionally-represented senate with a third of its members named by the president. Lukashenko's aides shrugged off Sharetsky's charge. \"If there was a dictatorship they would n't have the right to say things like this,\" Sergei Posukhov, Lukashenko's political adviser, told Reuters. \"The people have asked us to establish order and that's our main aim.\" Lukashenko, 41, won presidential polls in 1994 on promises to restore order, fight corruption and repair the strong links with Russia that were disrupted by the collapse of the Soviet Union. But during his period in office he has battled against nationalist opponents, trade unions and parliament and Sharetsky said the current parliament was ready to try to impeach him. \"This constitution, which has been prepared in secret, aims to gather all power in one man's hands,\" he said. \"We should not be fooled by his quasi-democratic rhetoric and his methods, like this referendum.\" Lukashenko signed a pact with Moscow in April to create a strong economic and political union which he believes could grow into a federation. But nationalist groups, scared by the prospect of renewed Moscow domination and Russia's backing for Lukashenko, protested against the deal. Lukashenko responded by cracking down on the nationalist opposition and jailing nearly 200 people for taking part in demonstrations against the pact.

Yuri Kushko TAVILDARA, Tajikistan 1996-08-30 Tajik government troops now control of the strategically vital town of Tavildara after driving out Islamic rebels, but sporadic gunfire still echoed in the nearby Pamir mountains on Friday. The commander-in-chief of Tajikistan's armed forces, Major-General Nikolai Sherbatov, took a group of journalists by helicopter to the remote, and now devastated, town to show that his forces held it. He said his troops took Tavildara without casualties on August 23, but the crack of sniper and machinegun fire revealed the presence of opposition fighters in the surrounding mountains. Sherbatov said the rebels were located about three km (two miles) east of Tavildara around the village of Layron. Tavildara, 200 km (120 miles) east of the capital Dushanbe, was in ruins. Shells had smashed roofs and windows and empty shell cases littered the streets. The town straddles a strategically important road linking government and rebel-held territory and has fallen succesively to both sides in a bloody tug-of-war which began last February. Tajikistan, which borders Afghanistan and China, has been split by a dragging four-year conflict after a civil war between communists and a frail coalition of Islamic and liberal groups. Tens of thousands of people have been killed and many more have been displaced in the fighting, which breached a shaky United Nations-sponsored ceasefire. Tavildara is now apparently inhabited only by a few old men, women and their grubby, barefoot children. Fruit remained on the trees as there was no one to pick it. \"Help me, help me,\" said a chorus of women begging soldiers for food. The town's school and a shop doubling as a warehouse for humanitarian aid were destroyed in the fighting. \"We had to build our own earth shelters to survive the fighting,\" said Rajab Adinayev, a bearded elderly Tajik in a long white shirt. Although shy in front of the government soldiers, several inhabitants accused government forces of widespread looting of homes and livestock. They also said rebel fighters had looted medicines from the local hospital. One elderly man, who declined to give his name, said two of his sons were now refugees in Moscow and the other two had left to fight for the opposition.

The ODS, a party in which Klaus often tries to emulate the style of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, has been in control of Czech politics since winning general elections in 1992. Zieleniec in the summer led calls for the party and its leadership to listen to more diverse opinions, a thinly-veiled criticism of Klaus who has spearheaded the country's post-Communist economic reforms.

Marcin Grajewski WARSAW 1996-12-06 Poland said on Friday that Swiss bank accounts, which in many cases belonged to Polish Jews who died in the Holocaust, were used in debt settlements between the two countries after the World War Two. Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati, unveiling first findings of a special government commission, said that in 1970s the then communist Poland received 460,000 Swiss francs from the accounts. \"In 1970s, Poland received from unclaimed accounts in Switzerland a sum of 460,000 francs. What was its right (to the money)...I do not know,\" Rosati told a news conference. Switzerland stands accused by Senator Alfonse D'Amato, chairman of the powerful U.S. Senate Banking Committee, of agreeing to give money to Poland from unclaimed bank accounts of Polish citizens, as part of an accord on compensating Swiss nationals whose assets had been seized in communist Poland. Many of these citizens were Jews murdered during the war, when Nazi German invaders killed most of Poland's 3.5 million Jews. Rosati did not say whether the payment in 1970s was part of the 1949 agreement between Warsaw and Switzerland on compensation to Swiss citizens whose assets were seized by the Soviet-imposed communists authorities after World War Two. \"I expect that the commission will finish gathering information within two to three weeks and then more details will be provided,\" Rosati said. Rosati confirmed that the 1949 agreement had provided for granting Switzerland about 53 million francs and most of this sum was repaid with coal exports. He said, however, that Switzerland did get about 16,000 francs from the so-called \"dead accounts\" as part of the compensation. \"About 16,000 francs were seized from accounts of four or five Polish citizens, whose data we do not precisely know. The issue is of moral and legal nature, because its financial significance is small,\" Rosati said. Under pressure from international Jewish organisations, Swiss government has devised a plan to pay out millions of dollars in unclaimed bank accounts as a conciliatory gesture toward Holocaust victims. The conservative Radical Democrats (FDP) have said they would ask parliament next week to order Swiss banks to put some 40 million Swiss francs ($ 31 million) in dormant wealth into a fund earmarked for Jewish groups and charitable organisations.

Cofinec's Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) opened at 5,200 forints on the BSE, down 600 from Thursday's close, following the release of its first half results this morning. Cofinec CEO Stephen Frater told reporters in a conference call from Vienna on Friday before the opening of the bourse that he expects a stronger second half, although the group will not be able to achieve its annual profit goal. \"We will not achieve the full 37 million French franc (net) profit forecast,\" Frater said. \"Obviously, we cannot make up the unexpected decrease that has been experienced in the first half of the year.\" Frater declined to give a forecast for the full year, ahead of a supervisory board meeting next week.

In the conference call, Frater said he regarded Cofinec GDRs-- which are trading below their issue price of 6,425 forints-- as a buying opportunity. \"Obviously, at some point it represents a buying opportunity,\" Frater said. \"I think the reality is that we operate in emerging markets, emerging markets tend to be more volatile.\" \"My message is that the fundamental strategy of the company, its fundamental market position has not changed.\" The group, which operates in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, reported an operating profit before interest of 21.8 million French francs compared to 34.1 million in the same six months of 1995.

Steven Silber WARSAW 1996-12-06 Polish brewer Zywiec's 1996 profit slump may last into next year due in part to hefty depreciation charges, but recent high investment should help the firm defend its 10-percent market share, the firm's chief executive said. Company President Jean van Boxmeer told Reuters in an interview on Friday that the firm, whose net profit fell 77 percent in the first 10 months of 1996 despite a 30-percent rise in sales, might only post slightly better profits in 1997 before having a chance to make a more significant turnaround. So far this year Zywiec, whose full name is Zaklady Piwowarskie w Zywcu SA, has netted six million zlotys on sales of 224 million zlotys. It has produced 1.5 million hectolitres. Van Boxmeer would not say how much higher 1997 profits or market share could be but said sales of leading Polish brewers should rise as the country's young urban professionals gradually switch from vodka to beer. \"The perspective on growth is such that reasonably we can think that somewhere between 65 and 80 litres per year is certainly reachable,\" van Boxmeer said on Polish per-capita beer consumption, currently around 40 litres. He said the 65-80-litre level could be reached in the next ten years and make Poland, with its 40-million population, Europe's third largest beer market after Germany and Britain. Van Boxmeer said Poland's top five brewers, which produce about 55 percent of the country's beer, could all raise market share as some of the numerous small brewers fall to competition from the large brewers with foreign investors. Zywiec is 31.8-percent owned by Heineken while Carlsberg has the same amount in Okocim. Earlier this year South African Breweries Ltd (SAB) bought strategic stakes in the unlisted Lech and Tychy brewers, which together hold more than 20 percent of the market, and Australia's Brewpole BV has a controlling stake in Poland's larges t brewery, Elbrewery Company Ltd. (EB). Van Boxmeer said the tough competition had prevented Zywiec from raising prices in line with inflation, which had added to the pressure on the firm's margins. He said advertising costs would also increase in the fight for market share. But he said the company's investment of more than $ 100 million already this decade, largely in production, would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring Czech Republic. Some analysts say cheaper but high-quality Czech imports could invade Poland once tariffs for CEFTA countries are lifted in 1998, but van Boxmeer says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the Czech beer market's overcapacity. \"I think Polish consumers in general are quite proud of their beers-- and I'm speaking about all the brands-- and as we make good beers... I think that this fidelity to our beers is a factor which can limit the Czech beers,\" he said. Van Boxmeer said Zywiec had its eye on Okocim, which has said it would start producing Carlsberg beer next year, but that Zywiec's potential production of Heineken was a medium-term possibility rather than a short-term one. He said his firm would be better off concentrating on its leading brand, Zywiec Full Light, which accounts for 85 percent of sales and is the country's largest-selling brand. \"You will not win the war of the Polish beer market with imported international brands,\" van Boxmeer said, adding that Heineken would remain an up-market import in Poland. Van Boxmeer also said Zywiec would be boosted by its recent shedding of soft drinks which only accounted for about three percent of the firm's overall sales and for which 7.6 million zlotys in provisions had already been made.-- Warsaw Newsroom+48 22 653 9700", "value": [{"start": 74, "end": 80, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 339, "end": 346, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 883, "end": 889, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 1148, "end": 1154, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 1290, "end": 1297, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 1371, "end": 1378, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"}, {"start": 1730, "end": 1743, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa"}, {"start": 2487, "end": 2492, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic"}, {"start": 2514, "end": 2520, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 2642, "end": 2647, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic"}, {"start": 2685, "end": 2691, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 2887, "end": 2892, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic"}, {"start": 3342, "end": 3348, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 3473, "end": 3480, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}]}, {"text": "Romania cen bank one-week rate rises to 50.19 pct.

It was the second time Brunswijk had been charged with attempted murder in less than two years. In 1994 he served two months for shooting a thief in the backside.

Mishi Saran HONG KONG 1996-08-30 Far East gold traders thumped foreheads in frustration at the market's foot-dragging this week and forecast on Friday that next week would not be much better. The Southeast Asian gold market was more or less a photo-fit picture of the previous week's position with activity slow and bullion prices trapped in a well-worn range awaiting a seasonal upturn in demand and prices into the fourth quarter. Singapore premiums for Australian kilo bars were quoted unchanged at between 25-45 cents an ounce over spot loco London prices, with South Korean and Indonesian-origin premiums also steady at 10-20 cents an ounce. Singapore dealers said they were concerned that there had been a marked revival in offers to sell gold by South Korean traders, following the distress sales of recent months after the Seoul government's crackdown on bullion arbitrage trade. \"I was shocked to see these offers coming in again, though there's been no indication of price or volume. I dread to think what will happen to the premiums if the Koreans start selling in force,\" one dealer said. Continued dishoarding of kilo-bars by Indonesian sources ahead of next year's presidential election has also kept a lid on premiums. Gold closed down at $ 387.00 / $ 387.50 an ounce in Hong Kong on Friday, versus New York's $ 387.60 / $ 388 finish on Thursday. Dealers said the precious metal eased on a report that the International Monetary Fund might sell some of its gold to reduce the debts of the poorest developing countries. Easier silver prices mid-week helped keep spot gold locked in a $ 386 - $ 389 an ounce range, dealers said, but they remained optimistic that the usual seasonal pick-up in jewellery fabrication demand would see gold at $ 395 by end-October. \"I still think we'll see gold at $ 395 by the end of October, in a retracement of the $ 418 - $ 380 move we saw at the start of the year,\" one said.

Edna Fernandes LONDON 1996-12-06 The British government warned Friday that it would refer the proposed trans-Atlantic alliance between British Airways Plc and American Airlines to Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission unless the carriers complied with a number of conditions. Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang added that even if the conditions were met by both airlines, final clearance would hinge on an open skies deal between Britain and the United States to liberalise trans-Atlantic air traffic, which would create greater competition on the routes. Lang said he supported conditions proposed by Britain's Office of Fair Trading, which was asked to examine the case last month. \"I agree... that without suitable undertakings the alliance would be likely to lead to a significant loss of actual and potential passengers, on those routes where BA and AA currently compete and for all passengers on the trans-Atlantic market route between the UK and U.S.,\" he said. His comments came just minutes after the latest set of open skies talks ended in London with no deal signed. Industry sources said there was no new date for fresh talks and blamed the deadlock on uncertainty over whether the British Airways-American deal would be cleared. The conditions for clearance of the alliance were that British Airways and American drop 168 slots at London Heathrow airport, the busiest in Europe. American's parent, AMR Corp., said it did not view the terms as a \"deal breaker.\" However, it called the conditions \"more severe\" than those imposed by other regulatory authorities on similar airline alliances. British Airways's initial response was that \"unconditional divestiture of slots is unprecedented and if done it must be on the basis of fair market value.\" It added that it would be \"prepared to take reasonable steps to assist the introduction of additional competition.\" The government also wants British Airways to drop a clause in its agreement with USAir that bars it from competing on trans-Atlantic routes, and said both British Airways and American should be prepared to reduce services on the London to Dallas-Fort Worth route in the event that a new entrant wishes to enter. It also suggested losing some slots on the London-to-Boston route. The Office of Fair Trade called for British Airways / American to allow third-party access to their joint frequent flyer programme where the applicant does not have access to an equivalent programme.

Pierre Belec NEW YORK 1996-08-30 For Wall Street, this is the season to be cautious as the presidential contest puts the stock market in the twilight zone. President Clinton, Bob Dole and Ross Perot are hitting the road now that the partying is over, and people who have billions of dollars invested in stocks were bracing for political promises that could have an impact on their wealth. Analysts believe that the candidates will add to the market's list of uncertainties, which already includes the question of whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to cool economic growth. They say the politicians will need to promote legislation that helps the economy without scaring the socks off financial markets. \"The worst thing that could happen for financial markets is that if Clinton and Dole start to trade shots in the middle of the ring with one-upmanship,\" said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. \"That's when Wall Street will need to worry.\" He said that the bond market would be the first to react if the \"bidding\" intensifies and stocks would quickly drop as interest rates rise. \"I do n't think it would imply the collapse of the stock market, unless the rise in rates touches off a dynamic within the market, which would include selling by portfolio managers, redemptions by individuals of mutual funds that would, in turn, pressure the portfolio managers to sell even more stock.\" This week, the market weighed Dole's proposal to lower federal income taxes by 15 percent across the board, a package that carries a price tag of $ 548 billion. Clinton proposes an $ 8.4 billion re-election agenda that would spare most home-sellers from capital gains taxes and give employers tax incentives to hire people off the welfare rolls. Clinton claims Dole's plan would increase the deficit, while the White House said some corporate taxes would be raised to offset the cost of the president's plan. The experts said there are some unusual risks for the market from this year's political season because the rush to promise tax cuts to win votes could upset Wall Street's expectations that Washington will balance the budget. \"The stock market will have to edit the promises and then do a probability study on those edited promises,\" said John Geraghty at the consulting firm North American Equity Services. During the past four presidential elections, the candidate that has favoured tax cuts has won. Ronald Reagan's tax cut won him a second four-year term in the White House in 1984, while Democrat Walter Mondale, who promised higher taxes, lost. George Bush became president in 1988 on his no-new-tax campaign and Clinton won in 1992 with a promise to fatten workers ' paychecks. The trick, they said, will be for the candidates to continue to convince Wall Street that the Treasury's 30-year bond-- the most closely-watched interest rate-- will fall to between 4 percent and 5 percent by the end of the decade. Johnson said that long-term interest rates have already been spooked by the election. The long-term bond jumped this week to 7.13 percent after starting the year at 5.95 percent. The surge of buying in stocks during the last two years has come amid an environment of low interest rates, which has boosted corporate profits. But the market stalled this summer after the Dow Jones industrial average set a record high of 5,778.00 points on May 22. \"The market does n't seem to be able to make new highs and it has been back and forth in a fairly horizontal mode which looks like a holding pattern,\" said Geraghty. He said the market reflects the political uncertainty, now that Dole has sharply narrowed the gap with Clinton in the polls. Geraghty said that the one thing that could completely turn the election around are new findings in the Whitewater scandal that would damage the Clintons. \"Stocks are on a delicate edge because if something happens that looks like it could upset the presidency, it could throw the political and, to some extent the economic, process into chaos,\" Geraghty said. Right now, Wall Street is pondering the candidates. \"We have an election where there are so many unknown variables that most people will probably want to hold fire, and even take the chance that they will have to pay higher prices for stocks after the November election, than take the risk that a shock to the system will hurt the stock market,\" Geraghty said. On Friday, the Dow Jones index closed down 31.44 points at 5,616.21. For the week, it was down 106.53 points. The Nasdaq composite index closed 3.53 points lower Friday at 1,141.50.

Glenn Somerville WASHINGTON 1996-08-30 Factory orders rose in July and manufacturing surged in the Midwest in August, reports said Friday, sparking worries about inflation that battered financial markets for a second straight day. The Commerce Department said orders for manufactured goods climbed 1.8 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion-- nearly twice the increase that had been expected. Shipments of everything from new cars to food items rose, as did order backlogs, in a sign that the strength in the industrial sector would continue in coming months. A separate report from Chicago area purchasing managers underlined the strength in manufacturing as the group's barometer of manufacturing in the region jumped to 60 in August from 51.2 in July. A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing. While production and orders rose at Midwest area businesses, the prices they paid for goods used in manufacturing remained well in check. Analysts said the reports implied the economy was not slowing down in the third quarter after a burst of growth in the spring, and that the lull in late June and July was more temporary than Federal Reserve policy-makers had wanted. \"It appears that August is showing an economy again reversing course and is not moving onto a significantly slower track at this point,\" said economist Lynn Reaser of Barnett Banks Inc. in Jacksonville, Fla. The reports fanned worries on Wall Street that the Fed, the nation's central bank, would raise rates next month in a bid to ward off inflation, driving stock and bond prices sharply lower for a second day running. The 30-year Treasury fell almost a point, raising its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, to 7.12 percent from 7.04 percent late Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.44 points to 5,616.21 after a 64.73-point decline Thursday. A third report from the Commerce Department, on July personal income and spending, pointed to a potential slowdown in consumer spending that some analysts said may help moderate growth in the second half. It showed spending rose only 0.2 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June. Incomes from wages, salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June. July's slight gain in incomes was the weakest in six months, since January when they were flat. Economist Joel Naroff of First Union bank in Philadelphia said consumer spending, which fuels two-thirds of the nation's economy, may be much slower in the third quarter than in the first half, which should slow economic growth. \"The FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) has been forecasting a slowing in economic activity and moderating household demand will have a large impact on overall economic growth,\" Naroff said in a written comment. The policy-making FOMC is to meet on Sept. 24 to plot interest-rate strategy. It already has adopted a bias toward raising rates to keep a lid on wage and price rises and help sustain the 5-1 / 2-year-old economic expansion. In an interview on the cable television network CNBC Friday, Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence Lindsey said there still were \"mixed signals\" about the economy's direction. \"I think that, on balance, it is looking a little bit on the strong side,\" Lindsey said. He added that with expansion as solid as it is and with unemployment so low \"the greater risks are clearly that we might see some overheating.\" While July consumer spending rose only slightly, there were ample indications that consumers remained confident. The University of Michigan's August index of consumer sentiment, made available on Friday to paying subscribers, rose to 95.3 from 94.7 in July. Reaser said strong consumer confidence coupled with relatively lean inventories were providing manufacturers with a reason to gear up production. \"The economy is not going to be expanding at the 4.8 percent (annual) rate that we had in the second quarter but it is likely to keep expanding in the 3 percent range,\" she said, above the 2 percent to 2-1/4 percent that the Fed considers to be non-inflationary. New orders to factories were strong for durable goods like new cars and for nondurables like paper and food products. Orders for durable goods, meant to last three years or more, rose a revised 1.7 percent in July after falling 0.2 percent in June. Orders for nondurables jumped 1.8 percent following a 1.2 percent decrease in June.", "value": [{"start": 645, "end": 652, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"}, {"start": 1480, "end": 1491, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street"}, {"start": 2562, "end": 2574, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia"}, {"start": 2751, "end": 2755, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee"}, {"start": 3271, "end": 3287, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_B._Lindsey"}, {"start": 4219, "end": 4222, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_System"}]}, {"text": "New meningitis scare hits Britain.

Under the administration's proposal, the borders to the Mexican produce would be opened into 19 Northern and Northeastern states from November through February. The plan has raised a storm of protest from U.S. avocado growers, who are largely concentrated in California. California growers have charged that removing the restrictions, even on a limited basis, would endanger the $ 1 billion U.S. industry if potentially harmful Mexican insects were brought into the country along with the avocados. Mexican officials contend that there is no scientific basis for the ban, and that it is illegal under international trading rules of the World Trade Organisation. Proponents of the plan discount the worries of the U.S. growers and say the plan has enough safeguards built into it to eliminate any significant threat to American producers. Under the proposal, only imports of export-quality avocados growing in approved orchards in Michoacan, Mexico, the country's main avocado area, would be allowed. Mexican growers and distributors would have to abide by strict rules established by the Mexican and U.S. agriculture agencies. The California Avocado Commission-- which has spearheaded the opposition to lifting the ban-- said new data the group submitted to the Agriculture Department last spring shows the department underestimated the pest problem in Mexico and have urged that the agency reopen its study of the issue. The administration is still studying the new data, and officials have said that if experts think the information is significant, the agency could reopen its investigation. But U.S. avocado industry sources said that while they may have delayed the plan for a while, they ultimately do not expect the administration to change its position. \"From a common-sense view, the department should reconsider this plan, but due to politics they will probably go ahead with this,\" said Tom Bellamore of the California avocado group. Administration officials said they want to get the issue resolved as quickly as possible, but said there is no timetable they are working under. \"It's a very complicated issue,\" said the Agriculture Department's Drazek. \"We'll get it resolved as quickly as we can, based on the best available science.\"", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 7, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"}, {"start": 33, "end": 37, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 74, "end": 101, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture"}, {"start": 129, "end": 136, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"}, {"start": 764, "end": 771, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"}, {"start": 838, "end": 845, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"}, {"start": 987, "end": 991, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1041, "end": 1052, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"}, {"start": 1053, "end": 1063, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"}, {"start": 1173, "end": 1177, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1210, "end": 1217, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"}, {"start": 1281, "end": 1288, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"}, {"start": 1495, "end": 1499, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1600, "end": 1608, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1723, "end": 1730, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"}, {"start": 1782, "end": 1789, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"}, {"start": 1870, "end": 1877, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"}, {"start": 1913, "end": 1923, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"}, {"start": 2044, "end": 2066, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture"}, {"start": 2135, "end": 2141, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"}, {"start": 2700, "end": 2710, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"}]}, {"text": "Major's office-Conservatives still have majority.

CHICAGO 1996-08-30 Chicago Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, head of the second-largest U.S. Roman Catholic archdiocese, said on Friday his doctors had diagnosed him as having liver cancer and he had a year or less to live. Bernardin, 68, underwent extensive surgery for pancreatic cancer in June 1995 followed by months of chemotherapy, which he said made him more aware of his own vulnerabilities and the need to minister to the sick. \"On Wednesday, examinations indicated that the cancer has returned, this time in the liver. I am told that it is terminal and that my life expectancy is one year or less,\" a composed Bernardin told a news conference. In 14 years as Chicago's archbishop, he built a prayerful, saintly image and was deeply involved in world church issues and publicly committed to rooting out abuses by clergy. \"I have been assured that I still have some quality time left,\" he said, saying he would undergo a new form of chemotherapy but his doctors have told him there was only a slim chance of a cure and the liver cancer was inoperable. \"It's not going to be easy to say goodbye to everybody. Death does have some sad dimensions to it but I am a man of faith,\" he said. \"Death is a natural phenomenom.\" He said he would \"serve until the end\" as cardinal. Pancreatic cancer is among the most deadly forms of the disease, although Bernardin's case was caught early. Surgeons removed a cancerous kidney, parts of his pancreas and stomach, small intestine, bile duct and surrounding tissues. He made a rapid recovery and resumed most of his duties, but then developed a deteriorating condition in his spine that caused him great pain and shortened his height by several inches. He was scheduled to undergo back surgery next month, but that was cancelled when the cancer was discovered in his liver in order to avoid delaying the start of chemotherapy. The spare, soft-spoken son of an Italian stonecutter took over the Chicago archdiocese, the nation's second-largest after Los Angeles, with 2.3 million parishioners, in 1982. Ironically, Bernardin, who developed a progressive, much-praised programme to deal with pedophilia involving priests, became the highest-ranking church official ever accused of sexual improprieties when a former seminary student leveled charges in 1993 that he had been sexually abused by Bernardin during the 1970s. Bernardin steadfastly denied the charges and the former student later recanted his tale of abuse. Bernardin prayed with him before he died from AIDS last year. Bernardin, who became archbishop of Cincinnati in 1972, played an increasingly prominent role in the U.S. church as a moderate voice of compromise among liberals and conservatives in the ranks of the bishops. This month, he announced that he would oversee a series of conferences to find \"common ground\" among American Catholics. Previously, he was instrumental in drafting church policy on war, peace and nuclear arms, and for seven years he headed the bishops ' anti-abortion policy committee, espousing a policy describing human life as a \"seamless garment.\"", "value": [{"start": 50, "end": 57, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"}, {"start": 69, "end": 76, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"}, {"start": 131, "end": 135, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 663, "end": 672, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Hinault"}, {"start": 1947, "end": 1954, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"}, {"start": 1981, "end": 1988, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"}, {"start": 2378, "end": 2387, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Hinault"}, {"start": 2406, "end": 2415, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Hinault"}, {"start": 2504, "end": 2513, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Hinault"}, {"start": 2602, "end": 2612, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati"}, {"start": 2876, "end": 2884, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}]}, {"text": "Electronic Data bags flight data contract.

Jones & Co. \"Whoever wants a big market position in the Midwest has to come in and grab Mercantile or Commerce.\" St. Louis-based Mercantile Bancorp Inc., a bank holding company with $ 18.04 billion in assets, was seen by many analysts as the most attractive Missouri franchise in size after Boatmen's. Kansas City, Mo.-based Commerce Bancshares Inc., with $ 9.32 billion in assets, also could help a regional bank establish a strong presence in the lower Midwest, analysts added. \"It focuses more attention on Mercantile, Commerce and Roosevelt,\" said James Weber, analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons. Roosevelt Financial Group Inc is a $ 9.33 billion asset-St. Louis based thrift. \"Now... the most coveted bank out there is Mercantile,\" Weber said. Mercantile and Commerce did not return phone calls seeking comment. Among those seen as having an interest in buying in Missouri are Minneapolis-based First Bank System Inc. and Norwest Corp., Ohio-based KeyCorp and Banc One Corp., and First Chicago NBD Corp. in Illinois. Representatives of First Bank, Norwest, Banc One and First Chicago said the banks do not comment on rumors of possible mergers or acquisitions. KeyCorp, contacted by phone, would not comment. With a presence in nine states and $ 41 billion in assets, Boatmen's was the prize in Missouri, where barriers to outside acquirers were brought down last year by a federal banking statute. \"Boatmen's was the plum of Missouri and was the plum of the central Midwest,\" Weber said. Talk that the Missouri banks were seeking inflated prices from buyers was seen as a reason a deal has not occurred sooner. But NationsBank's bid, representing a premium of 40 percent for Boatmen's stock, was large enough to get the deal done. \"I think Boatmen's was shopping itself, and everybody knew if you wanted to be the winning buyer here, you had to make the bid nobody would beat,\" Ancell said. But some analysts cautioned that other targets should not expect as large a premium. They also questioned whether NationsBank can recoup shareholder value with such a large bid for Boatmen's. \"I think initially some stocks will trade up on sympathy, but the wild premium NationsBank put on this deal here, I do n't see a lot of other deals being done at this premium,\" said Michael Durante, analyst at McDonald & Co.", "value": [{"start": 54, "end": 61, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"}, {"start": 341, "end": 348, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States"}, {"start": 723, "end": 731, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri"}, {"start": 1330, "end": 1338, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri"}, {"start": 1403, "end": 1413, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio"}, {"start": 1473, "end": 1482, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"}, {"start": 1536, "end": 1549, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Chicago_Bank"}, {"start": 1892, "end": 1900, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri"}, {"start": 1969, "end": 1977, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri"}, {"start": 2472, "end": 2483, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NationsBank"}, {"start": 2629, "end": 2640, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NationsBank"}]}, {"text": "RTRS - Cricket - Play restarts in Australia-West Indies match.

A 20-ton piece of the Titanic's steel hull, which had been attached by cables to a recovery ship off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada, fell back to the bottom of the sea, said Erin Purcell of Boston-based Reagan Communications that represents two of the ships used in the expedition. The piece of hull, lifted from the ocean floor by means of several diesel-filled bags, had been stuck about 200 feet (about 70 metres) below the water's surface before it fell, she said. It fell as recovery crews were trying to haul the piece into more shallow water and several of the bags burst and cables snapped, she said. The steel-hulled Titanic, thought to be unsinkable, struck an iceberg on April 14, 1912, and sank, killing 1,523 of the 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The wreck was located in 1985.

Israel announced this week the expansion of Jewish West Bank settlements surrounding Jerusalem and the demolition of an Arab community centre in East Jerusalem. City officials there said the centre was being erected illegally. But Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said the moves by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government were tantamount to war. Tension has been rising in the region since. \"We believe that the Israeli settlement policy in the occupied areas is an obstacle to the establishment of peace,\" German Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said. \"All concerned must avoid taking any course of action that could pose an obstacle to the peace process and which could make a peaceful solution difficult,\" he said, as news came of a renewed breakdown in Arab-Israeli peace talks in Jerusalem. Erdmann told reporters Bonn supported European Union efforts to persuade Israel to stop further Jewish settlement on the West Bank. The foreign ministry later announced Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy would visit Bonn for talks with his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel next month. The ministry said Levy and Kinkel would discuss the Middle East process and German-Israeli relations at their meeting on September 9. Levy's visit would be the first by an Israeli cabinet minister since Netanyahu's conservative government took power in une this year, the ministry said. Before Levy's arrival in Bonn, German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe will visit Israel from September 2 to 4, the defence ministry said.

A Guinean man, detained in a round-up in the Saint-Bernard church a week ago, was deported on a scheduled Air France flight to Conakry after his appeals failed, a spokesman for Air France's pro-Socialist CFDT union said. He was apparently the eighth African deported from among 210 people evicted from the church after a 50-day occupation aimed at securing residence permits, unions said. Most of the others have been released after a brief stay in detention. About 100 people from the CFDT and the Communist-led CGT unions marched outside Air France headquarters at Charles de Gaulle airport north of Paris against the use of civilian jets and staff in deporting illegal immigrants. \"We must obtain a formal commitment from (Air France chairman) Christian Blanc that no plane, no personnel be used to transform our air companies into charters of shame,\" CFDT spokesman Francois Cabrera said. He said civilians should not be police accomplices. Twenty-three out of 25 charters flying illegal immigrants home since Prime Minister Alain Juppe's government took office in May 1995 have been civilian jets. The other two were military jets.

Brendan Intindola NEW YORK 1996-12-06 Homestake Mining Co tops Wall Street's list as the most likely white knight buyer for Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp if Santa Fe rejects unsolicited suitor Newmont Mining Corp. Santa Fe is so far mum on the more than $ 2 billion stock swap takeover proposal from Newmont, announced Thursday. Wall Street, since the bid, has speculated that any deal between Newmont and Santa Fe would be a \"bear hug,\" or a reluctantly negotiated agreement where the buyer is not necessarily a friendly suitor. Newmont said the companies have had previous contact, though declined to detail the encounters. Analysts predict Santa Fe will go to the highest bidder, and that if a rival buyer is found, Newmont may not be able to match its offer. They said the Santa Fe deal, which includes desirable Nevada mining territory, would only payoff for Newmont longer term. Newmont, in fact, will not benefit from the Santa Fe acquisition on an earnings basis for at least two years, which also limits its capacity to raise its offer. Any deal, friendly or hostile, would almost assuredly be a stock swap, which is necessary to preserve the tax-free, pooling-of-interest accounting, they said. Analysts and arbitrageurs immediately ruled out Barrick Gold Corp and Bre-X Minerals Ltd as Santa Fe saviors because they are locked in negotiations over their splitting Indonesia's Busang vast gold deposit. Placer Dome Inc too was considered unlikley because it is focusing on geographic expansion in areas that do match Santa Fe's Nevada, South America and Central Asia presence, they said. A Homestake spokesman was not immediately available to comment on speculation that it tops the list. Homestake, based in San Francisco, operates gold mines in the United States, Australia, Chile and Canada. Earnings in 1995 were $ 0.22 per share, or $ 30.3 million, on revenues of $ 746.3 million. Santa Fe is headquartered Albuquerque, N.M. and reported 1995 earnings of $ 0.30 per share, or $ 40 million, on revenues of $ 350 million. Santa Fe has mining and exploration operations in Nevada, California, Montana, Canada, Brazil, Australia, Chile, Kazakstan, Mexico and Ghana. PaineWebber analyst Marc Cohen said he lowered his rating on Newmont to neutral from attractive today because if Newmont merged with Santa Fe, investors would have to wait until the second half of 1998 to realize earnings accretion. \"I think Homestake could come in as a white knight, but how much is someone willing to come in above the Newmont number. One would have to outbid by at least 15 percent, but there is going to be a (Santa Fe) deal with someone,\" he said. \"Longer term, two to three years out, (a Newmont-Santa Fe deal) is positive, it does all the right things.

The spread between benchmark bonds narrowed 77 basis points from 81 basis points at the close of trading on Wednesday. Statistics Canada on Friday reported Canada's current account moved to a higher-than-expected C$ 1.15 billion second quarter surplus from a C$ 1.62 billion deficit in the first quarter. It was the first surplus since the fourth quarter of 1984. The agency also reported Canada's real gross domestic product rose a weaker-than-expected 0.3 percent in the second quarter or 1.3 percent at an annualized rate. While the data provided support for Canadian bonds, both Canadian and U.S. markets weakened after the release of strong U.S. economic data, including a report showing the Chicago Purchasing Managers August index rose to 60 from 51.2 in July. \"The purchasing managers ' number is extremely, extremely strong,\" said Webber.

Jonathan Wright NAIROBI 1996-12-06 The Canadian general in charge of a multinational force for eastern Zaire said on Friday he was going back to Zaire for more information about the plight of about 165,000 Rwandan refugees adrift in the countryside. Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril told a news conference in Nairobi his main concern was for a large group of about 150,000 refugees living off the land in a valley about 65 km (40 miles) west of the eastern city of Goma. If he decided it was necessary and safe for the aircrew, he would not hesitate to order airdrops of food for the refugees, even against the wishes of the government in Kinshasa and the Zairean rebels who control much of eastern Zaire, he said. \"Tomorrow I'm going into Rwanda and my intention is to go across into eastern Zaire and try to find out for the second time what the situation is on the ground,\" he said. General Baril saw rebel leader Laurent Kabila in Goma last week but the rebels told him the crisis was over because most of the Rwandan refugees have already gone home. The rebels do not want the multinational force to deploy on the ground, for fear it might help the Zairean army regain control of the area. Kinshasa opposes airdrops, apparently because the food could fall into the hands of the rebels and their local supporters. Canadian Defence Minister Doug Young said on Thursday that the multinational force would probably not have to make food airdrops or intervene militarily in any major way. \"It does n't look as though they (airdrops) are going to be required in any significant way because the NGOs (non-governmental organisations) are in that area on the border between Zaire and Rwanda,\" Young told reporters. But General Baril said it would be premature to rule out any course of action until he had more information. \"We hope that if the front moves forward or stabilises then we will have access (to the large group of refugees) with reconnaissance or humanitarian agencies.\" If they ca n't move because they are too weak, then we will probably consider very seriously using air delivery means (airdrops)...It's complex, it's dangerous for the air crew that fly in there and it will have to be absolutely necessary. If it is necessary, I wo n't hesitate to use it, \"he said. Asked if he would disregard the objections of the Zairean government, he said :\" It would have to be in the last resort. It would have to mean that tens of thousands of lives are in danger. Do you think that I would have a conscience problem doing it or not at that time? And my mandate is also under Chapter Seven to operate in eastern Zaire. \"Under Chapter Seven of the U.N. charter, the Security Council has wide powers to preserve peace and security.\" I know their (the Zairean government's) position and I know it's very delicate and we are very sensitive to their position also, \"the general added. He denied that his contacts, criticised by Kinshasa, with the Zairean rebels amounted to negotiations.\" I do n't negotiate, \"he said.\" I coordinate with those who are holding ground and that's a wise thing to do. When we do n't know where the front is, we do n't know what the risk is. \"Baril said that apart from the group of 150,000, U.S. and British reconnaissance plans had tracked two much smaller groups of refugees-- one of up to 1,000 north of the town of Masisi and one of up to 8,000 on the road from Bukavu west to Kindu. The Kisangani office of the medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres said on Friday that more than 100,000 refugees were trekking northwest from the Goma-Bukavu area and many of them were now in the town of Walikale.

Palestinian President Arafat, attacking Israel's decision to expand Jewish settlements and its policy on Jerusalem, went before the Palestinian legislature on Wednesday to urge the two million Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza to go to the holy city. Pilgrims stood little chance of making progress. Palestinians have been banned by Israel from travelling from the West Bank to Jerusalem since suicide bombings by Moslem militants killed 59 people in the Jewish state in February and March.

Raphael Kopessoua BANGUI 1996-12-06 A former cabinet minister in Central African Republic and his son were abducted from their home and murdered in growing ethnic violence in the capital Bangui, a government minister said on Friday. With violence spiralling out of control, France voiced backing for the elected Bangui government but said its troops based in the former colony under defence pacts would not help it combat army mutineers. \"France cannot be involved in the domestic political debate,\" President Jacques Chirac told a news conference at the end of a Franco-African summit in Burkina Faso. \"French troops may only take part in maintaining order to avoid major abuses and protect foreign communities,\" he said. Public Service Minister David Dofara, who is the head of the national Red Cross, told Reuters he had seen the bodies of former interior minister Christophe Grelombe and his son, who was not named. Witnesses said they had been seized by troops loyal to President Ange-Felix Patasse at dawn on Thursday when they clashed with soldiers staging a mutiny since November 16. Grelombe is from the Yakoma tribe to which most of the rebel soldiers belong. The uprising began over pay demands but has turned into a campaign to topple Patasse, sparking ethnic violence and dividing the capital. The former minister and his son had been taken from their home close to the presidential palace, which is guarded by loyalist soldiers backed by French troops based in Bangui. The bodies were found on Thursday in an open field about two km (one mile) further away, said Dofora and other witnesses. The men were seized as loyalist forces and French troops fought gunbattles with mutineers who fired rockets into the city centre. A French-owned hotel was slightly damaged. Yakomas are hounded in stronghold districts of Patasse's Baya people while other tribes have fled areas in rebel hands. Roadblocks have been erected in city districts while central Bangui, which is patrolled by French troops with tanks, is deserted. Shops and businesses have remained shut this week. The Franco-African summit decided to send a mission Bangui to seek ways of containing the mutiny and a threat of civil war. Chirac said Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore would visit Bangui \"in the coming hours\" with the heads of state of Gabon, Mali and Chad to try and establish dialogue between authorities and rebels. The mutiny forced Patasse to miss the summit. His spokesman had predicted the meeting to send an assessment mission. Patasse, who won Central Africa's first multi-party elections, refuses to resign. Church-led meadiation attempts hit deadlock over rebel demands for his departure. Soldiers staged mutinies in April and May, with French troops stepping in with tanks and helicopters to quell the more serious second uprising. Patasse offered concessions and amnesty to rebels before the May rebellion ended after rebels looted the city centre. Rebels accuse Patasse of tribalism and of arming his civilian supporters and hired guns from Sudan and Chad. Mutineers have vowed to disarm all civilians and to chase out the foreign forces knwon as Codos. Hospital sources and witnesses said about 10 people were known to have been killed in the more than two weeks of fighting, including two rebels killed in Thursday's clashes. An undetermined number of people are reported to have been abducted and killed outside the town by tribal vigilante groups. In Thursday's fighting, French troops fired back as mutineers trying to break out of their strongholds rained mortar shells on the city centre.", "value": [{"start": 324, "end": 330, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"start": 362, "end": 368, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangui"}, {"start": 560, "end": 574, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Chirac"}, {"start": 859, "end": 866, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 1035, "end": 1053, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ange-F\u00e9lix_Patass\u00e9"}, {"start": 1502, "end": 1508, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"start": 1698, "end": 1704, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"start": 2039, "end": 2045, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"start": 2181, "end": 2187, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangui"}, {"start": 2288, "end": 2303, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Compaor\u00e9"}, {"start": 2316, "end": 2322, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangui"}, {"start": 2372, "end": 2378, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabon"}, {"start": 2379, "end": 2383, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali"}, {"start": 2388, "end": 2392, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad"}, {"start": 2473, "end": 2480, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ange-F\u00e9lix_Patass\u00e9"}, {"start": 2784, "end": 2790, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"start": 2880, "end": 2887, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ange-F\u00e9lix_Patass\u00e9"}, {"start": 3012, "end": 3019, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ange-F\u00e9lix_Patass\u00e9"}, {"start": 3091, "end": 3096, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan"}, {"start": 3526, "end": 3532, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}]}, {"text": "Consumer spending, incomes edge up in July. Glenn Somerville WASHINGTON 1996-08-30 Consumer spending barely edged up in July, the Commerce Department said Friday, as income growth slowed abruptly to the weakest pace in six months. Spending rose 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June. Incomes from wages, salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June. Department officials said July's slight gain in incomes was the weakest for any month since January, when they were flat. Wages and salaries came under pressure in July as a shorter average workweek and lower hourly earnings cut into paychecks. The department said wages and salaries decreased by $ 6.9 billion in July after climbing $ 45 billion in June. \"In July, average weekly hours and average hourly earnings declined, more than offsetting the effect of an increase in employment,\" Commerce said. But more money went into savings accounts, as savings held at 5.3 cents out of each dollar earned in both June and July. That was the highest savings rate since October last year, when 5.5 cents out of each dollar earned was being saved. The generally lackluster report on spending and incomes in July had been expected. At the same time, the department said in a separate report that new orders received by U.S. factories climbed strongly in July, with widespread gains across most major categories. Orders increased 1.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion, significantly stronger than the 1 percent rise forecast by Wall Street economists. That followed a revised 0.7 percent decline in June orders. Commerce said previously that spending at retail stores was up only 0.1 percent in July, partly because of softer sales of new cars and light trucks. In addition, the Labour Department's July employment report had foreshadowed the muted income growth. It showed average hourly earnings fell in July by 0.2 percent to $ 11.00 and the average workweek shortened to 34.3 hours from 34.7 in June. Gains in personal income, which includes wages and salaries as well as income from sources such as dividends, interest and businesses, are essential for funding consumer purchases, which fuel two-thirds of national economic activity. Spending on all types of durable goods, which includes cars, fell to an annual rate of $ 626.3 billion in July from $ 633.6 billion in June. But spending on nondurable products increased moderately to a rate of $ 1.55 trillion from $ 1.54 trillion in June, while spending for services was up to $ 2.97 trillion in July from $ 2.96 trillion. Payrolls of manufacturing companies rose in July by $ 2.3 billion to an annual rate of $ 678 billion.", "value": [{"start": 1403, "end": 1407, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}]}, {"text": "Five die as SAfrican crop plane hits pickup.

The dollar rose slightly against the German mark, but edged lower against the Japanese yen. The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 64.73 points at 5,647.65, its largest drop since July 15, when it closed with a loss of 161 points. In the broader market, declining issues beat advances 1,627 to 743 on moderate volume of 321 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. In the bond market, the 30-year Treasury bond fell 23/32 of a point, or $ 7.1875 on a $ 1,000 bond, raising its yield to 7.04 percent-- the highest since July 31-- from 6.98 percent at Wednesday's close. \"Seven percent creates psychological problems and a legitimate competitor for money from equities,\" said Ralph Bloch, chief technical analyst at Raymond James. \"We could carry another 100 points lower in the Dow,\" he said. \"I'm telling clients things are dicey going into next Friday (Sept. 6) so let's be careful.\" Wall Street on Sept. 6 faces the key monthly employment report, which has been known to cause dramatic swings in stock prices. \"We had two very strong economic reports,\" said David Shulman, Salomon Bros. ' chief equity strategist. \"There are more worries in bond land. Fears of a Fed tightening next month have resurfaced for the first time since the end of July.\" The Commerce Department reported that the nation's gross domestic product expanded at a 4.8 percent annual rate in the three months from April through June instead of the 4.2 percent estimated a month ago. In another report, sales of new homes jumped unexpectedly in July to the briskest rate in five months, driving prices up in a strong housing market. Sales shot up 7.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 783,000 units-- the strongest since February, when new homes were selling at a rate of 784,000 a year. Analysts said the stock market was also worried about the impact on President Clinton's re-election bid of his top political strategist resigning. Dick Morris, who is credited with resurrecting Clinton's political fortunes over the past 18 months by masterminding his turn to the political centre, quit after a supermarket tabloid reported he engaged in a yearlong affair with a prostitute, with whom he allegedly shared confidential campaign documents. Analysts said Wall Street had grown accustomed to a moderate Republican in the form of Democratic President Clinton. Morris ' departure raised fears that Clinton would veer more to the left in a second term. The dollar closed at 1.4772 marks, up from 1.4767 late Wednesday. The dollar slipped to 108.40 yen from 108.45. Oil markets rose sharply on a combination of low stocks, two hurricanes and allegations of illicit trading by Iraq. September heating oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed 1.63 cents higher at 63.67 cents a gallon, September unleaded gasoline finished 1.39 cents up at 63.72 cents a gallon and October crude rose 44 cents to $ 22.15 a barrel. December cotton closed 0.95 cent higher at 77.06 cents per pound on the New York Cotton Exchange despite some easing of concern about the twin hurricane threat to key U.S. growing areas with forecasts indicating both storms may remain offshore.

David Jones MILAN 1996-08-30 Italian tyre and cables giant Pirelli on Friday announced its long-awaited move into China with a cables joint venture set to capitalise on the rapidly-growing Chinese telecommunications market. Pirelli is linking with Hong Kong-based group CITIC Pacific in a venture to be called the Wuxi Tong Ling Company Ltd, which will operate in partnership with a local industrial company at its existing factory in Wuxi, Jiangsu province, Shanghai. The partners will invest around $ 30 million in the existing copper cable plant at Wuxi to update technology and include optic fibre production, with annual turnover expected to reach $ 60 million within the next few years. The move marks a further move by Pirelli's cables division to expand in the fast-growing Far Eastern developing markets with the group already present in Indonesia, India and Malaysia. \"This is really positive news for Pirelli, and I expect that it will produce one of the best half-year results in late September compared to other industrial Italian companies,\" said analyst Paula Buratti at Indosuez. She emphasised that the move was positive because Pirelli will have management control of the Chinese venture, and it also showed another example of Pirelli exporting its technical know-how to developing markets. Pirelli shares reacted favourable even though talks had been underway for some time and news about a venture had been widely expected. The shares rose 0.2 percent to 2,555 lire by 1350 GMT in an easier Milan stock market. This will be Pirelli's first industrial involvement in a Chinese market where demand for telecommunication networks is expected to grow to 80-100 million new lines between 1996 and 2000, doubling demand for optical cables. China's second largest telecoms operator Unicom already has a mandate from the central government to establish 15 million new phone lines by the year 2000, which will necessitate new trunk line systems and local distribution networks. \"The starting of this production base in China has for our group an undoubted strategic value, representing an important enhancement of our presence in Asia,\" said Pirelli SpA chairman and chief executive officer Marco Tonchetti Provera. Pirelli Cables has global sales of over $ 3.5 billion, and has become a large supplier of optic cables and systems to major telecoms carriers in the U.S., Europe and the Far East. CITIC Pacific is a major Hong Kong-listed company focusing on infrastruture, trading, distribution and property, with 28 percent of its 1995 profits coming from telecoms.

Flavio Cotti, the chairman of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), told German radio the Vienna-based body viewed the conflict in Chechnya as an internal Russian problem. \"The OSCE is completely involved. But one must not forget that the OSCE only has limited powers there,\" said Cotti, who is also the Swiss foreign minister. \"Our mission in Chechnya has done all it can within the given limitations.\" Pro-Moscow leaders in Chechnya have criticised Tim Guldimann, the Swiss diplomat who heads the OSCE Chechnya mission, saying he was biased toward Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, president of the self-declared separatist government. Russian peacemaker Alexander Lebed and Chechen separatist military leader Aslan Maskhadov started a new round of peace talks on Friday just outside the rebel region.

Norilsk officials declined to comment. Analysts said the government, while anxious about Norilsk's debts, is highly unlikely to bring the nickel, copper, cobalt, platinum and platinum group metals producer to its knees or take measures that could significantly affect output. But it also wants Norilsk, the world's second-largest nickel producer, to clean up its act. \"The procedure of bankruptcy will be applied,\" Tass quoted Livshits as telling Duma deputies about Norilsk. It indirectly quoted him as saying Norilsk should first pay salary arrears, which in the past have led to worker strikes. \"It is unlikely that Norilsk will pay these debts in the near-term-- the company will remain a debtor in the near future,\" Chernyshev said. He estimated the company's regional debts at least one trillion roubles and said 30 percent of the giant Krasnoyarsk regional budget was fuelled by Norilsk money. Norilsk's new majority shareholder, Russian commerical bank Uneximbank, has said it is reorganising metal exports through Interrosimpex in order to boost revenues. But the changes have yet to improve significantly Norilsk's situation. \"Uneximbank has inherited a mountain and whether or not they climb out and over it remains to be seen,\" said one metals source. Norilsk said in September that it total debts, including unpaid salaries to workers, were 13 trillion roubles.

Rolf Soderlind LONGYEAR, Norway 1996-08-30 The windblown, chilly streets of this tiny Arctic town are all but deserted and flags are flying at half-mast beneath a brooding, clouded sky. Longyear is a town in mourning, a close-knit community that has been shattered. Disaster struck on Thursday when a Russian airliner bringing coal miners to work crashed as it came in to land at the airport, killing all 141 people on board. \"It's a sight I will never forget. I will remember it for the rest of my life,\" said Stig Onarheim. He was one of a handful of rescuers who raced to the scene of the crash in a helicopter on Thursday, hoping in vain to find survivors. The plane smashed into a snow-capped mountain on the Arctic island of Spitzbergen on Thursday, just east of Longyear. \"Imagine a big plane with a lot of luggage and people on board. Think of all that mixed together, with twisted, wrecked parts on the slope,\" Onarheim, 29, told Reuters. Police and local officials have sealed off the crash site, protecting it from intrusive reporters and from the polar bears that roam freely across the icy expanses. The dead were all Russians and Ukrainians, coming to work in the mining towns of Barentsburg and Pyramiden. Longyear is a Norwegian settlement of just over 1,000 people, but it also feels the loss keenly. \"I have trouble finding the words to express my grief. It's a tragedy for everyone. We know many of the people who live in Barentsburg, some of them could have been on the plane,\" said Johan Sletten, 52. Sletten, a caretaker who has lived on the island for 30 years, said the Norwegian and Russian communities visit frequently, competing at soccer in the summer and with snow-scooter races in the winter. Teenage shop assistant Heidi Groenstein was blunter. \"I'm glad it was not a Norwegian plane,\" she said. \"Just think of it-- a mining village where so many workers die. They must be having a tough time of it now.\" Barentsburg, just a few hours ride by snow-scooter or 15 minutes by helicopter from Longyear, has asked to be left alone with its grief and told reporters to stay away. Around 100 Russian and Ukrainian miners were waiting in Longyear to fly home on the plane that crashed. They were given shelter in the town's church overnight and ate a sombre breakfast before getting on a bus for the airport. Another plane had been sent from Moscow to pick them up. At this time of year, the only colour in Longyear comes from the brightly-painted wooden houses. Everything else is muddy, the waters of the fjord leaden. Winter is in the air. Barentsburg is an even grimmer place, a run-down testament to the hardships of the new Russia. Spitzbergen lies some 500 miles (800 km) off the northern tip of Norway and endures one of the most extreme climates on the planet. Inhabited by fewer than 3,000 people in total, it sees the sun for 24 hours a day during summer and is plunged into round-the-clock darkness in the winter months. The terrain is mountainous, the only roads are dirt tracks. Norway rules the island group under the terms of a 1920s international treaty which gave many other nations the right to establish setttlements and exploit the coal that is still mined there.

The blue-chip IPC index ended down 1.29 points, or 43.56 percent, at 3,333.05. Volume was regular at 74.7 million shares traded. Mexican stocks were also hurt by U.S. long bond rates which had begun to rise before Greenspan's comments and were inflated by employment data released before trade began in Mexico. Yields on U.S. 30-year Treasury bonds were 6.51 percent when stock trading closed in Mexico, unchanged from Thursday. On the broad market, 107 stocks changed hands, of which losers well outnumbered winners by 75 to 13. Traders noted the lack of blue chips or stocks traded at significant volume among the gainers. Simec, the steelmaking arm of the debt-ridden Sidek group headed the losers, off 7 centavos (1 cent) at 1.40 pesos (18 cents). Sidek fell 4 centavos (1 cent) to 95 centavos (12 cents).

Simona de Logu RIO DE JANEIRO 1996-12-06 Plastic surgery is booming, especially among men, as Brazilians spend much of their new-found wealth on the latest beauty treatments, said the organisers of a four-day international plastic surgery conference that opened on Friday. The number of plastic surgeries in Brazil has jumped 30 percent to an estimated 150,000 this year since an anti-inflation plan was introduced in July 1994, Farid Hakme, the president of the Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society (SBCP), said. The number of operations on men increased even more-- by 80 percent, from 8,000 in 1994 to 15,000 in 1995, he said. \"Brazil ranks right at the top for plastic surgery with respect to the number of surgeons, the number of patients, number of operations, number of conferences. Our statistics are the highest for everything,\" Hakme said. \"We believe the increase in plastic surgeries for men results from the difficulties in the job market. People need to have a more youthful look to compete in the job market, given the profound changes in Latin America's economy.\" A controlled exchange rate, trade liberalisation and tight monetary policies have also dramatically curbed inflation, making more money available for cosmetic surgery. Brazil has been at the forefront in plastic surgery for decades and is home to one of the most famous surgeons, Ivo Pitangy. There are 6,000 plastic surgeons there, of which 4,500 have qualified to be members of the SBCP. Every year, 500 new plastic surgeons graduate in Brazil and medical students from all over the world come to study there. Hakme attributes Brazil's fascination with plastic surgery not to excessive vanity but to the country's mix and match of different races, which can create physical disharmonies. \"What happens is the nose sometimes does n't match the mouth or the buttocks do n't match with the legs,\" he said. Brazil's most sought-after beauty treatment is liposuction in which fat is sucked away from areas of the body, with about 30,000 operations a year at a cost of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 each. Stomach tucks and breast operations are also popular since the tropical climate calls for flesh-baring fashions, but unlike women elsewhere Brazilians tend to have breast reductions and buttock implants. \"The women who want to reduce their breasts here would probably want to increase them in the United States,\" SBCP Vice-President Oswaldo Saldanha said. \"Beauty ideals and cultures are different in every country.\" Plastic surgery scares like the case in which Brazilian model Claudia Liz fell into a coma after being anaesthetised for a liposuction in October are not much of a deterrent. Saldanha said operations fell 30 percent immediately after that case but the rate was back to normal now.", "value": [{"start": 346, "end": 352, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1289, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"}, {"start": 1554, "end": 1560, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"}, {"start": 2568, "end": 2577, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"}]}, {"text": "Singapore hangs Thai drug trafficker.

LA CORUNA, Spain 1996-08-31 A late goal by newly-signed defender Roberto Carlos saved the blushes of Real Madrid coach Fabio Capello and his multi-billion peseta line-up in the opening game of the Spanish championship on Saturday. The Brazilian's 79th-minute effort was enough to earn Real a point from a scrappy 1-1 draw at fellow title contenders Deportivo Coruna. Deportivo started strongly, taking the lead midway through the first half when former Auxerre playmaker Corentine Martins headed home a corner after a flick-on by Brazilian-born Spanish international midfielder Donato. Real looked to be in deep trouble shortly after the break when Luis Milla was sent off for committing two bookable offences in as many minutes. But Deportivo were unable to capitalise on their numerical advantage, and were themselves reduced to ten men when Armando Alvarez was sent off 15 minutes from time. Shortly afterwards Roberto Carlos found space in the home defence and equalised for Real with a shot that was deflected past despairing Deportivo ' keeper Jacques Songo'o. In a frantic final five minutes there were chances at both ends, and Donato, who had earlier been booked, was sent off for protesting about the incursion of Real players at a free kick. Before the match Deportivo chairman Augusto Lendoiro said he would ignore a FIFA decision banning Brazilian midfielder Mauro Silva from playing in the match for failing to join his national side's tour of Europe. In the event, coach John Toshack decided not to use Silva, who had claimed he did not join the Brazil squad because he had lost his passport.", "value": [{"start": 67, "end": 72, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"}, {"start": 121, "end": 135, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Carlos_(footballer)"}, {"start": 157, "end": 168, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F."}, {"start": 175, "end": 188, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabio_Capello"}, {"start": 253, "end": 260, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"}, {"start": 341, "end": 345, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F."}, {"start": 423, "end": 432, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportivo_de_La_Coru\u00f1a"}, {"start": 509, "end": 516, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJ_Auxerre"}, {"start": 601, "end": 608, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"}, {"start": 642, "end": 646, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F."}, {"start": 705, "end": 715, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Milla"}, {"start": 790, "end": 799, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportivo_de_La_Coru\u00f1a"}, {"start": 970, "end": 984, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Carlos_(footballer)"}, {"start": 1035, "end": 1039, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_C.F."}, {"start": 1087, "end": 1096, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportivo_de_La_Coru\u00f1a"}, {"start": 1326, "end": 1335, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportivo_de_La_Coru\u00f1a"}, {"start": 1407, "end": 1416, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"}, {"start": 1428, "end": 1439, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauro_Silva"}, {"start": 1542, "end": 1554, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Toshack"}]}, {"text": "Chile, Mexico to seek to broaden trade deal.

DILI, East Timor 1996-12-06 East Timorese Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo left Dili on Friday on his way to Norway for the awards ceremony as co-recipient of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize. Witnesses said Belo left the territory for the Indonesian capital Jakarta accompanied by five other people. It was not immediately known when he would arrive in Oslo. The bishop will jointly receive the Nobel award next Tuesday with East Timorese-born activist Jose Ramos Horta, who lives in self-exile in Australia. The Indonesian government has condemned the inclusion of Ramos Horta in the award, and Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said on Friday that Indonesia would not be represented officially at the ceremony in the Norwegian capital. \"I sincerely believe that this unfortunate choice in giving the honour to such a controversial figure as Ramos Horta... will exacerbate the problem in finding a solution (to East Timor),\" Alatas said on Friday. He was responding to questions at a news conference called to discuss next week's ministerial meeting of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) in Jakarta. Ramos Horta has been a vocal leader of the opposition to Jakarta's rule in the territory. Belo and Ramos Horta were awared the prize for their efforts to secure a peaceful solution to the issue of East Timor, a former Portuguese colony which Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year. The United Nations has never recognised Jakarta's move. Alatas said the government's position on the Nobel Peace Prize would have been different if it had been awarded solely to Belo. Asked if the Indonesian ambassador to Norway would have attended the ceremony if only Belo had been involved, Alatas replied : \"Probably, yes, but that is a hypothetical question.\" Alatas said on Tuesday that on his way back from Oslo, Belo would visit the Vatican to see the Pope, and would also meet German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn.

Seven truckloads of armed riot police and three fire engines were on standby at one of the junctions near the institute. There were no clashes. \"They are now back in the YIT campus,\" an institute official who declined to be identified told Reuters by telephone. One of two roads leading to the University of Yangon from the institute had been closed by authorities.

She was allowed to move freely on Thursday. The protest culminated at dawn on Tuesday with several hundred students being detained briefly by police in central Rangoon. The street protests were the biggest seen in the capital since the student-led pro-democracry demonstrations of September 1988 when the junta crushed the uprising. Thousands were killed or imprisoned. Earlier on Friday some of the students, who were held briefly by police during the protests earlier this week, said they were still dissatisfied with the military government. They told Reuters they were unhappy that the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) had not heeded their calls for the right to organise independent unions on campus. \"We still want government answers to our demands. We want police punishment to be published in newspapers,\" one student said. But the students stressed their protests were non-political and they had no contact with Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD). Suu Kyi, a Nobel laureate and daughter of independence hero Aung San, and key NLD officials have also denied any link with the students. But they have said both parties had a \"moral link\" in that they were against police brutality and injustice. The students also demanded the government announce punishments meted out to policemen who they said had manhandled students involved in a brawl with some restaurant owners near the Yangon institute in October.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06 International trade union leaders on Friday expressed outrage that the head of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) had been barred from speaking at next week's WTO meeting in Singapore. Bill Jordan, general secretary of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), told a news conference the withdrawal of a WTO invitation to ILO director general Michel Hansenne was \"outrageous behaviour on the part of an organisation that wants to command respect in the world\". Jordan said a small group of developing nations that oppose linking trade talks and labour conditions had pressured World Trade Organisation (WTO) officials to prevent Hansenne from taking the platform to urge such links. \"It is to their shame that those who are responsible for encouraging this meeting responded (to the pressure) in silencing him,\" Jordan said after the opening of an ICFTU conference on international labour standards and trade. The three-day trade union conference in Singapore hopes to push labour issues onto the WTO agenda. Jordan said the WTO's credibility was at stake over the issue of trade and labour. The ICFTU said it wanted the WTO conference beginning on Monday to outlaw forced and child labour, end discrimination in hiring, and guarantee the right to join a union. Bill Brett, chairman of the ILO Workers Group, told Reuters before the news conference he was \"not too surprised, but very disappointed\" that the speaking invitation had been withdrawn. \"Some governments are very determined to stop the issue (of trade and labour rights) being discussed,\" he said, adding that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) seemed particularly hostile to the ILO agenda. ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The ILO wants a trade and labour rights \"social clause\" included in the final ministerial statement issued by WTO leaders at the end of the meeting, the organization's first ministerial-level gathering. Speaking to ICFTU delegates, Richard Eglin, director of the WTO secretariat, said the WTO was capable of making a significant contribution to governmental efforts to solve social problems.

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06 Indian rubber demand is seen outpacing local production in the 1996/97 April / March season and the trend will persist way into the next century, the chairman of the Rubber Board of India said on Friday. K.J. Matthew said at the Asia Rubber Markets meeting here Indian production of natural rubber in 1996/97 will reach 547,000 tonnes against projected demand of 578,000 tonnes, a gap of 31,000 tonnes. For synthetic rubber, production reached 68,200 tonnes in 1995/96 while consumption in the same season hit 134,085 tonnes, Matthew added. \"Though schemes designed to realise further increases in the production of natural rubber are being operated successfully, the demand-supply gap is expected to widen,\" he said. Indian synthetic rubber output is not expected to rise significantly in the next season but demand will rise to 145,000 tonnes. Matthew estimates that by the 2000/01 season, the gap between natural rubber output and consumption will rise to 51,000 tonnes and 319,000 tonnes in 2010/11. Natural rubber production will go up to 695,000 tonnes in 2000/01 against consumption of 746,000 tonnes. In 2010/11, domestic demand should rise further to 1.233 million tonnes while production will only reach about 914,000 tonnes. One way to bridge the widening gap is to put more land under cultivation which the Rubber Board official estimates will reach 220,000 hectares between now and the year 2003 although Matthew said this may not be possible at this time in India. \"The development objective for the rubber plantation industry will be to increase production to the best extent possibly with a view to minimising imports of natural rubber,\" he said.-- Singapore Newsroom (65-8703305)", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 6, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"}, {"start": 51, "end": 60, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 72, "end": 78, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"}, {"start": 334, "end": 340, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"}, {"start": 790, "end": 796, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"}, {"start": 1544, "end": 1550, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"}]}, {"text": "CRICKET - ENGLAND BEAT PAKISTAN BY 107 RUNS IN SECOND ONE-DAYER.

George Nishiyama TOKYO 1996-12-06 Comments by Japan's tight-lipped central bank chief and an influential top bureaucrat are further signs that the nation's authorities want to keep the dollar at current levels, market sources said on Friday. In a rare expression of a view on currencies by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) governor, Yasuo Matsushita was quoted in Japan's leading economic daily on Friday as saying that he sees no further, immediate fall in the yen. This followed a widely watched television appearance late on Thursday by Eisuke Sakakibara, a high-ranking Finance Ministry official, who denied he had said he wants to guide the dollar lower to between 108 and 110 yen. But many in the market thought Sakakibara's real intentions lay elsewhere, and took more notice of his comments about the U.S. government's stance on the dollar, dealers said. \"I think his views on (U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert) Rubin's comments were indeed what he himself thinks about the dollar,\" said Hank Note, chief dealer at Sumitomo Bank. Asked about Rubin's comment that a strong dollar was in U.S. interests, Sakakibara said the remark does not necessarily mean the United States supports a stronger dollar. \"It's a strong dollar, not stronger. In that sense, the comments are not pointing to a certain direction,\" he said. \"It shows that Sakakibara is not for a stronger dollar either,\" said Sumitomo's Note. Takao Sakoh, first vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in Tokyo, said : \"Maybe a dollar at 104.50 yen is not acceptable (to Sakakibara), but it may be okay at the current level, at the lower end of 112 yen.\" Market participants have kept a close eye on Sakakibara, chief of the ministry's International Finance Bureau, as a comment he made in November after the dollar hit this year's high of 114.92 yen pushed the currency down sharply. He had said then that the market's view on Japan's economy was too pessimistic and that he believed it was stronger than the market thought. Dealers have come to refer to 115 yen as the \"Sakakibara ceiling\" for the dollar following the remark. Adding to the comments by \"Mr Yen\", as Sakakibara is known for his prominence in the currency market, was BOJ governor Matsushita's remark. \"The recent level of the yen exchange rate has been stable, and it does not appear to be moving towards a further depreciation of the yen immediately, so import prices are likely to stabilise at current levels,\" Matsushita said in an interview with the Nihon Keizai Shimbun. \"The fact that he touched on the issue of inflation triggered by import prices shows that the BOJ does not want a further depreciation of the yen, past 115 yen,\" said Yasuhito Kawashima, chief forex manager at Toyo Trust & Banking Co. Some said the central bank may have been concerned a weaker yen would lead to unfounded pessimism about Japan's economy. \"There was concern that foreign investors may sell Japanese stocks if the dollar goes above 115 yen. The BOJ does not want the yen's weakness to lead to pessimism over the economy,\" said Taisuke Tanaka, market strategist with Credit Suisse in Tokyo. Senior BOJ officials have separately said financial markets ' views on the economy have been too negative. \"I realise there are negative views in the markets about the impact of the consumption tax hike and drop in public spending, but the markets appear to be exaggerating the magnitude of the negative impact,\" a senior BOJ official told Reuters on Friday.

Haitham Haddadin BEIRUT 1996-12-06 A Lebanese military court on Friday sentenced to death in absentia the commander of Israel's surrogate militia in south Lebanon on treason charges. The court convicted General Antoine Lahd, head of the South Lebanon Army (SLA), of collaborating with Israel with which Lebanon is officially at war. Lahd, a 69-year-old former Lebanese army major-general, heads the 3,000-strong SLA militia which helps Israel hold a border zone in south Lebanon to ward off cross-frontier guerrilla raids on northern Israel. Lahd said a few days after the trial began on February 16 that Lebanese authorities must drop the charges or risk blocking any peace deal with the Jewish state. He said Israel was capable of pressuring Lebanon's Syrian-backed government to stop the legal pursuit. The charges against Lahd were : forming a hostile army, carrying weapons on Israel's side, helping Israel strip off a part of Lebanese territory by violence, forming an armed gang, killing or trying to kill Lebanese civilians by artillery shelling and kidnapping Lebanese citizens for long periods. Shortly before Lahd's trial began, a Beirut military prosecutor charged another 89 former Lebanese army soldiers with collaborating with Israel. No date has been set for the trial of the men, all members of the SLA living in the Israeli-held zone in south Lebanon. Israel and Lahd have repeatedly demanded safety guarantees for the SLA-- a mixed Christian-Shi'ite Moslem force-- which the Jewish states regards as loyal allies. Israel has said the Lebanese army must incorporate the SLA fighters into its ranks as an army brigade as a condition for peace. But Lebanese political analysts have said that would be out of the question and Lebanese authorities pre-empted the issue by taking legal action against Lahd. Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, calling Lahd \"a great Lebanese patriot\", said earlier this year Lebanon had insulted the SLA commander by ordering his arrest on the treason charges. Peres, who was ousted in May by rightwing Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, said there could not be real negotiations with Lebanon \"unless it will stop the maltreatment of the SLA and its commanders.\" The Beirut military court also sentenced to life in jail in absentia Etian Saqr, former head of the pro-Israeli Guardians of the Cedars, a small rightwing Christian civil war militia. Saqr, whose trial was concurrent with Lahd's, was convicted of \"contacting the Israeli enemy, passing information to Israel and undertaking hostile acts against Lebanon\".", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 7, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 85, "end": 93, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 333, "end": 339, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 351, "end": 358, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 484, "end": 490, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 653, "end": 661, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 737, "end": 743, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews"}, {"start": 759, "end": 765, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 953, "end": 959, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 1190, "end": 1196, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut"}, {"start": 1290, "end": 1297, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 1418, "end": 1424, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 1581, "end": 1587, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 1601, "end": 1609, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 1713, "end": 1721, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 1789, "end": 1797, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 1875, "end": 1882, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 1976, "end": 1983, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 2104, "end": 2111, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 2186, "end": 2193, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 2268, "end": 2274, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut"}, {"start": 2364, "end": 2375, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionism"}, {"start": 2527, "end": 2534, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 2565, "end": 2571, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}]}, {"text": "CRICKET - ENGLAND V PAKISTAN ONE-DAY SCOREBOARD.

ARLINGTON, Texas 1996-08-31 Juan Gonzalez homered twice and Ivan Rodriguez added a two-run shot as the Texas Rangers defeated the Cleveland Indians 5-3 in a matchup of division leaders Friday. Rodriguez's 18th homer, off Chad Ogea (7-5) in the first, gave Texas a 2-0 lead. One out later, Gonzalez smacked his 40th homer, extending his hitting streak to 20 games. Gonzalez, who hit in 21 straight games earlier this season, joined Mickey Rivers as the only players in Texas history with two 20-game streaks in the same year. Gonzalez hit his second homer in the third for his fifth multi-homer game of the season. Gonzalez has three 40-homer seasons and his 121 RBI broke Ruben Sierra's team record of 119 set in 1989. The Indians had their four-game winning streak stopped. \"It's not something I'm going to try to explain,\" said Texas manager Johnny Oates about his team winning seven of the 10 meetings from Cleveland this season. \"We've got two more regular season games against them and we might get lucky enough or unlucky enough to play them in the post-season.\" Roger Pavlik (15-7) gave up three runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings and became the fourth 15-game winner in the American League. Jeff Russell pitched two perfect innings for his third save. Brian Giles and Jim Thome homered for Cleveland. Cleveland's lead over the White Sox in the American League Central dropped to nine games. Texas's lead over Seattle in the West increased to six. At California, Tino Martinez's two-run homer keyed a three-run first and Andy Pettitte became the league's first 19-game winner as the New York Yankees beat the Angels 6-2. New York snapped a season-high five-game losing streak and also got homers from Mariano Duncan, Darryl Strawberry and Jim Leyritz. Pettite (19-7) allowed two runs and eight hits over eight innings with a walk and seven strikeouts. He improved to 12-2 following Yankees ' losses. Mariano Rivera pitched a scoreless ninth, striking out two. Ex-Yankee Randy Velarde hit his 11th homer, his most at any professional level. In Seattle, Pete Incaviglia's grand slam with one out in the sixth snapped a tie and lifted the Baltimore Orioles past the Seattle Mariners, 5-2. It was Incaviglia's sixth grand slam and 200th homer of his career. Baltimore's Eddie Murray cracked his 20th homer of the season and 499th of his career. Jay Buhner hit his 38th homer and Edgar Martinez his 23rd for Seattle. The Orioles remained tied with the White Sox for the American League wild card with the Mariners a game back. In Toronto, Kevin Tapani (12-8) allowed two runs and six hits over 7 1/3 innings and Frank Thomas hit his 29th homer and drove in three runs as the Chicago White Sox cruised to an 11-2 victory over the Blue Jays. Thomas, Harold Baines and Robin Ventura each collected three hits. Baines homered and scored three runs. Danny Tartabull added two hits and three RBI as all Chicago starters got at least one hit. In Oakland, Dave Telgheder scattered seven hits over eight innings and Mark McGwire hit his major-league leading 45th homer and drove in three runs as the Athetlics blanked the Boston Red Sox 7-0. Telgheder (2-5) snapped a personal three-game losing streak. Buddy Groom pitched a perfect ninth inning. McGwire singled home a run to spark a three-run sixth and capped the scoring with a two-run homer in the seventh. The loss was Boston's seventh in its last 29 games. In Detroit, Todd Van Poppel pitched a five-hitter for his first career shutout and Tony Clark homered to cap a four-run first inning as the Tigers blanked the Kansas City Royals 4-0. Van Poppel (3-6) walked two and struck out two in defeating the Royals for the second time this week. He threw 108 pitches as he lowered his ERA from 8.08 to 7.24. Kansas City has scored only one run in two games. In Milwaukee, Marc Newfield homered off Jose Parra (5-4) leading off the bottom of the 12th as the Brewers rallied for a 5-4 victory over the Minnesota Twins. Milwaukee has won 10 of its last 15. Bob Wickman (6-1) pitched 2 2/3 hitless innings for the win, his second for the Brewers. Matt Lawton hit a three-run homer off closer Mike Fetters with one out in the ninth to give Minnesota a 4-2 lead. But Milwaukee tied it up in the bottom of the ninth on pinch-hitter Dave Nilsson's two-run double.", "value": [{"start": 36, "end": 43, "tag":

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. 1996-12-06 Fourteen years after he bludgeoned and shot a man whose trailer home he robbed in 1982, John Mills Jr., 41, was put to death in Florida's electric chair Friday. As Glenn Lawhon, a rural Florida minister who is the victim's father, looked on, Mills was pronounced dead at 7:13 a.m. EST (1213 GMT) for the murder of Lester Lawhon. Speaking in Arabic, Mills made a final statement before an anonymous citizen flipped the switch that sent 2000 volts of electricity through his body, said Department of Corrections spokesman Eugene Morris, who was present at the execution. \"I bear witness that there is no God but Allah and I bear witness that the prophet Mohammed is the messenger of God,\" he quoted Mills as saying. Prison officials said they had no record of Mills ' official conversion, but they said that, on May 14, 1991, he had asked that a new name, Yuhanna Abdullah Muhammed, be added to his prison file, which is usually an indication of a conversion to Islam. Mills is the 38th person to die in Florida's electric chair since the U.S. Supreme Court reversed itself in 1976 and legalised the death penalty. Prison officials said Mills made no special request for a last meal and did not eat the steak, fried potatoes and orange juice offered him. He spent Thursday with family members and his spiritual adviser, Morris said. Mills was scheduled to die Wednesday but had his sentence temporarily postponed by the Florida Supreme Court. On Thursday, the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta denied his appeal in federal court. In March 1982, Mills and accomplice Michael Frederick knocked on the door of Lester Lawhon's trailer in an attempt to rob it, police said. Lester Lawhon was taken to a nearby airstrip where he was bludgeoned with a tire iron. Mills then fired two shots that killed Lawhon as the victim tried to run away. Frederick is serving a 347-year sentence.", "value": [{"start": 1571, "end": 1578, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta"}]}, {"text": "CRICKET - ESSEX AND KENT MADE TO SWEAT IN TITLE RACE.

Essex need another 148 with five wickets in hand to beat Yorkshire after a maiden first-class century from Richard Kettleborough transformed a match which his side had seemed certain to lose. Kent will also need to keep their nerve against struggling Nottinghamshire who will enter the final day 137 ahead with four wickets left in a relatively low-scoring match at Tunbridge Wells. Derbyshire, nine-wicket winners over Worcestershire, and Surrey, who thrashed Warwickshire by an innings and 164 runs, can instead take the day off along with rivals Leicestershire, who beat Somerset inside two days. Warwickshire captain Tim Munton is tipping Surrey to emerge on top, impressed by the positive influence of Australian coach Dave Gilbert, but Derbyshire's Australian captain Dean Jones is conceding nothing as his side chase their first title for 60 years. \"We took three absolutely brilliant catches in this match and our catching all season has been pretty impressive.

LONDON 1996-08-31 Former Wallaby captain Michael Lynagh began his career in English club rugby in impeccable fashion on Saturday to frustrate his old coach Bob Dwyer on his league coaching debut with Leicester. Lynagh kicked five penalties and a conversion from his six attempts at goal to steer his multi-national Saracens side to a 25-23 home win and offer millionaire backer Nigel Wray an early return on his big investment in the north London club. French centre Philippe Sella also enjoyed a good game alongside Lynagh, although the home team scored only one try through England scrum-half Kyran Bracken. The new French connection at Harlequins also made a good start, Laurent Cabannes and Laurent Benezech scoring a try apiece in their side's 75-19 victory over Gloucester. Former England captain Will Carling, handed the kicking duties, finished with 20 points. With the first day of the league season briefly shifting the spotlight away from the discord between the clubs and the Rugby Football Union, there were also emphatic victories for champions Bath, 56-13 winners over Orrell, and Northampton and narrow successes for Wasps and Bristol.", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 11, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union"}, {"start": 14, "end": 20, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lynagh"}, {"start": 61, "end": 67, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London"}, {"start": 86, "end": 93, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_rugby_union_team"}, {"start": 102, "end": 116, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lynagh"}, {"start": 137, "end": 144, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England"}, {"start": 217, "end": 226, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dwyer"}, {"start": 272, "end": 278, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lynagh"}, {"start": 514, "end": 520, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"start": 528, "end": 542, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Sella"}, {"start": 679, "end": 685, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"start": 735, "end": 751, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurent_Cabannes"}, {"start": 756, "end": 772, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurent_B\u00e9n\u00e9zech"}, {"start": 1157, "end": 1168, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northampton_Town_F.C."}, {"start": 1194, "end": 1199, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Wasps"}]}, {"text": "U.S. barges lightly quoted on call session.

CHICAGO 1996-12-06 As many as 1 million dog bites are recorded in the United States every year and half of them are provoked by humans, a veterinarian told fellow animal doctors on Friday. The Humane Society of the United States estimates that between 500,000 and one million bites are delivered by dogs each year, more than half of which are suffered by children. \"Most bites can be prevented by teaching children how to respect a dog,\" Michael Cornwell of the Glencoe Animal Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, told the annual meeting of the American Veterinary Medical Association. \"Let's not let our kids jump on them or crawl on them. Dogs and children do n't have to have an interaction. Let's respect their territories,\" he said. Cornwell said 50 percent of reported bites were provoked by a person and 60 percent were suffered by children. He also estimated that only 25 percent of bites were reported because medical attention was not needed. Don Rieck, president of the National Animal Control Association, said aggressiveness in dogs was related more to gender than breed and a male dog that had not been neutered was three times more likely to bite than an unspayed female. The five breeds credited with the most incidents were chow chows, Rottweilers, German shepherds, cocker spaniels and Dalmatians. \"The trends in dog bites by particular breeds have more to do with fad pets owned by individuals who need to have something unique.

The nominees, according to diplomats, are : Kofi Annan of Ghana, the U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeeping ; Ahmedou Ould Abdallah of Mauritania, the former U.N. special envoy for Burundi ; Amara Essy of the Ivory Coast, its foreign minister and the U.N.

It was not known if other candidates would step forward. Diplomats said General Joseph Garba of Nigeria, a U.N. General Assembly president in 1989-90, was putting forth his own candidacy without being nominated by his country. Boutros-Ghali on Wednesday opened the door for other Africans to contest his job by saying he was suspending temporarily his candidacy but was not withdrawing completely from the race. His supporters said this meant he remained a candidate in case the race reached an impasse. The United States on Nov. 19 vetoed his bid for re-election while the other 14 Security Council members supported him. The move by the African states means that the council could begin voting on candidates next week, a procedure that could either result in a decision or turn into a bitter fight with vetoes against each nominee.

Andy Colquhoun JOHANNESBURG 1996-08-31 South Africa managed to avoid a fifth successive defeat in 1996 at the hands of the All Blacks with an emphatic 32-22 victory in front of an ecstatic Ellis Park crowd on Saturday. They scored three tries in recording their highest total against New Zealand, salvaging some pride in a season in which the world champions have lost five out of eight tests. It also ended a run of nine successive victories this year for New Zealand but arrived too late to prevent a 2-1 series defeat and an historic first All Black series triumph on South African soil. Springbok scrum-half Joost van der Westhuizen was his side's inspiration, scoring their opening try and making the third for flanker Andre Venter from a quickly taken penalty to give his side a 29-8 lead after 54 minutes. Fullback Andre Joubert scored the other, scorching in from 40 metres at the start of the second half to add to his three long-range penalties. The All Blacks salvaged some pride by scoring two tries from centre Walter Little and scrum-half Justin Marshall in the final five minutes to close a gap which at one point stood at 24 points. But they generally endured an off-day, highlighted by recalled fly-half Andrew Mehrtens who missed five out of eight kicks at goal. Recalled fly-half Henry Honiball kicked the Springboks into a 6-0 lead after 10 minutes only to see Andrew Mehrtens launch a penalty from eight metres inside his own half to narrow the gap. Mehrtens missed three further penalties and a conversion in the first 40 minutes which could have put his side ahead, but it was the Springboks who looked the more dangerous. Their promise was realised when Joubert made a 40-metre break in the 25th minute and, although winger Pieter Hendriks appeared to knock on Joubert's reverse pass, Welsh referee Derek Bevan allowed Van der Westhuizen to pick up and score under the posts. Honiball converted and Joubert kicked a penalty before All Black hooker Sean Fitzpatrick scored a try from close range on the stroke of half-time to narrow the lead to 16-8 and hint at a comeback. Instead Joubert kicked another long penalty and then raced around the outside of the defence to score the Springboks ' second try. A quick penalty from Van der Westhuizen five metres from the All Black line set up the third try for Venter five minutes later and when Joubert kicked his third penalty the Springboks held an unassailable 32-8 lead going into the last quarter. When the All Blacks did break through, it was too late. Centre Walter Little followed up Mehrtens ' kick to score under the posts and scrum-half Justin Marshall forced himself over from a ruck close to the line in injury-time to give them some consolation.

In local currency terms, Italian BTPs offered returns of 0.85 percent in the week ended on Thursday, with fellow high-yielder Sweden close behind on 0.80 percent. The weekly government bond index rose 0.07 percent in local currency terms. France managed third place with 0.68 percent in the 16-nation world government bond index. Canada's were the worst performing bonds. They lost 2.21 percent, depressed by a wave of new Canadian supply. Returns on Treasuries were also in negative territory at minus 0.24 percent, the poorest result after Canada and British gilts which lost 0.28 percent. Australia was the only dollar-bloc country in the table to eke out a positive return, albeit a paltry 0.02 percent. German Bunds were not much better, offering returns of 0.05 percent, while Japanese government bonds managed a 0.38 percent gain. Spanish bonds, which had been top performers in Salomon Brothers ' league table for November as a whole, turned in a more subdued weekly performance with a return of only 0.27 percent. In U.S. dollar terms, Japan was the only country to give positive returns at 1.35 percent. France lost 0.37 percent, followed by Italy on minus 0.59 percent. The biggest losers in dollar terms were British gilts, which shed 3.41 percent, Canada with minus 3.03 percent and Australia at minus 1.54 percent.

The match boiled over when Hill made to walk off court after what he claimed was a game-winning point in the third. When the referee called Jansher's return good and the decision was accepted by the player, Hill shrieked at the Pakistani : \"You cheat.\" \"He was standing right there and knew the shot was down so I called him a cheat,\" said Hill, whose squash career has been blighted by fines and suspensions for unacceptable behaviour. \"He knew it was down and accepted what I called him because of that.\" Hill won the game on the next point and said later that Jansher was generally honest on court but played by the referee's decision. The Australian had upset Jansher's rhythm with his mixture of gamesmanship and fluent stroke-making but eventually succumbed 15-7 17-15 14-15 15-8. \"I changed my strategy against him today and had him rattled,\" he added. He is not as fit as he used to be be but was too good for me in the end. I shook him a bit but he will come out next time and be a better player for it-- that's Jansher. \"Jansher said that he was disturbed to be called a cheat.\" What he did was bad for squash, bad for the crowd and bad for the sponsors. \"We are trying to build up squash like tennis and players should not say things like that.\" I think the Professional Squash Association should look into this matter and deal with it properly. I am not calling for him to be banned but they have to take some action. \"Jansher, bidding for an eighth Hong Kong Open title, plays second-seeded Australian Rodney Eyles in the final. Eyles played his best squash of the tournament to beat fourth-seeded Peter Nicol of Scotland 15-10 8-15 15-10 15-4. Eyles, who defeated Jansher in the semifinals of the Portuguese Open in 1993, said that he would like to win for the good of the game.\" I have nothing against Jansher but it will be great if I could beat him, \"said Eyles.\" My biggest problem against Jansher is concentration.

Parnevik, who is seeking his first PGA Tour victory, moved to 19-under 194 for the tournament. Parnevik tied the 18-hole record set by Loren Roberts in 1994 at the Brown Deer Park Golf Course and also equalled Saturday by Greg Kraft. Nolan Henke, who led by two strokes entering the third round, carded a four-under 67 and was one stroke back at 18-under 195. He is striving for his fourth career PGA Tour victory and first since the 1993 BellSouth Classic. Tiger Woods, who made the cut in his first tournament as a professional, shot a two-over-par 73 and was four under for the tournament. The 20-year-old Woods, who turned professional Tuesday after winning an unprecedented third successive U.S. Amateur Championship, struggled on the front nine, bogeying the first and seventh holes and double-bogeying the par-four, 359-yard ninth hole. After bogeying the 10th hole to move to four-over for the round, he rallied for birdies on 15 and 18. After Parnevik started off his round by parring the first hole and bogeying the second, the Swede birdied six of the next seven holes. Parnevik continued to storm through the course, birdying three holes on the back nine, including two from 12 feet out on the 15th and 17th holes. \"I ca n't remember when I've putted this well,\" said Parnevik. \"I was disappointed when a 12-footer did n't go in.\" My game feels very good. I've been fading my driver but today whenever I set up for a fade it went straight. Whenever everyone's making birdies, you never want to be even par. \"Henke had a bogey-free round and birdied four holes, including a 45-footer on the par-three 215-yard seventh hole and one from 12 feet out on the 12th hole.\" I did n't hit it very well today, \"said Henke.\" Jasper blew right by me. Once he did, I knew I had to make birdies just to keep up. I made some really good pars.

Steve Stricker, who tied for second at last week's World Series of Golf, and Stuart Appleby were both five shots off the lead at 14 under.

Life on the road this year did not slow the Americans, who will try to avenge their 3-2 defeat in the final last year when they host Spain on September 28-29 in Atlantic City. \"Last year we stood on the court after we had lost and we put out hands together and made it our committment to bring back the Cup,\" U.S. captain Billie Jean King said at the draw. \"That is our sole goal.\" The United States edged Austria in Salzburg 3-2 in the opening round in April, and then blanked Japan 5-0 in Nagoya last month in the semifinals. The victory against Japan marked the Fed Cup debut of Monica Seles, who became a naturalised U.S. citizen in 1994. Seles easily won both her singles matches and King is counting on the co-world number one to lead the team again. \"I told Monica we need her if we want to win,\" King said. Seles's sore left shoulder and a wrist injury to Fed Cup veteran Mary Joe Fernandez have forced King to take a wait and see attitude regarding her squad for the best-of-five match. Fernandez was forced to withdraw from the U.S. Open. \"We will wait until the last minute so we check with everybody and their injuries,\" said King. \"What we like would be Seles, (Olympic champion Lindsay) Davenport and Mary Joe Fernandez.\" If she can get that threesome together, King will feel good about her chances against the Spain's formidable duo of Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Conchita Martinez. \"To be a great coach you have to have the right horses and I got the right horses,\" said King.", "value": [{"start": 16, "end": 20, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 142, "end": 147, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"}, {"start": 302, "end": 307, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"}, {"start": 361, "end": 372, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"}, {"start": 474, "end": 488, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic"}, {"start": 720, "end": 725, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"}, {"start": 909, "end": 925, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Jean_King"}, {"start": 973, "end": 986, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1065, "end": 1070, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"}, {"start": 1078, "end": 1084, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagoya"}, {"start": 1135, "end": 1140, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"}, {"start": 1208, "end": 1212, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1230, "end": 1235, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Seles"}, {"start": 1352, "end": 1358, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_(singer)"}, {"start": 1467, "end": 1485, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Joe_Fern\u00e1ndez"}, {"start": 1583, "end": 1592, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Joe_Fern\u00e1ndez"}, {"start": 1939, "end": 1962, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arantxa_S\u00e1nchez_Vicario"}]}, {"text": "Kansas feedlot cattle roundup - USDA.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-05 The United States Thursday blasted the release from a Greek prison of a Palestinian guerrilla convicted of bombing an airliner and killing a teenager in 1982, saying the move \"does not make sense.\" \"All of us who have been victimised by terrorists... need to stand together against terrorists. We ca n't let terrorists out of jail when they are a danger to civilians all around the world,\" State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said. ' Mohammed Rashid \"is a terrorist who deserves to be behind bars. It is inexplicable to us why he would have been allowed to leave Greece before serving his just sentence... This is an incomprehensible move. It does not make sense,\" Burns told a news briefing. He spoke after Rashid left Greece Thursday on being freed from prison early for good behaviour after serving 8-1/2 years. The Clinton administration's strong views on this subject have been conveyed to the Greek government, Burns said. Mahammad Rashid was whisked from Korydallos maximum security prison just outside Athens to the airport where he boarded a regular Olympic Airways flight to Cairo where he would transit to Tunis and the former Palestine Liberation Organisation headquarters. Rashid, 46, was sentenced to 18 years in prison by a Greek court in 1992 after being convicted of premeditated murder in the mid-air bombing of a Pan American airliner in 1982. His sentence had been reduced to 15 years in 1993. A parole court ruled recently that Rashid could be freed after serving 8-1/2 years, with time in pre-trial detention counted towards his term, but said he must be expelled immediately from Greece. The United States accuses Rashid of belonging to the May 15 Palestinian guerrilla group and being an accomplished student of master Palestinian bombmaker Abu Ibrahim. Three FBI agents who testified against Rashid during the trial, held at Korydallos prison, said they had ample evidence against Rashid for a bomb planted on a Pan American plane in Brazil in 1982 and a mid-air bomb blast on a TWA airliner approaching Athens in 1986 which killed four U.S. citizens.", "value": [{"start": 41, "end": 51, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C."}, {"start": 67, "end": 80, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 117, "end": 122, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece"}, {"start": 135, "end": 146, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Palestine"}, {"start": 480, "end": 494, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Nicholas_Burns"}, {"start": 632, "end": 638, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece"}, {"start": 789, "end": 795, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece"}, {"start": 888, "end": 895, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton"}, {"start": 968, "end": 973, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece"}, {"start": 1031, "end": 1041, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korydallos"}, {"start": 1079, "end": 1085, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens"}, {"start": 1128, "end": 1143, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Airlines"}, {"start": 1154, "end": 1159, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo"}, {"start": 1186, "end": 1191, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunis"}, {"start": 1308, "end": 1313, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece"}, {"start": 1672, "end": 1679, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece"}, {"start": 1684, "end": 1697, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1919, "end": 1929, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korydallos"}, {"start": 2028, "end": 2034, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"}, {"start": 2073, "end": 2076, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_World_Airlines"}, {"start": 2098, "end": 2104, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens"}, {"start": 2131, "end": 2135, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}]}, {"text": "BASEBALL - MAJOR LEAGUE STANDINGS AFTER FRIDAY'S GAMES.

Elif Kaban GENEVA 1996-12-06 In a gloomy Geneva conference centre built before the dawn of the Internet, groups of staid officials made a first stab on Friday at rewriting copyright laws for the digital age. But critics at the first government-level meeting to revise copyright laws in 25 years said the officials and legislators might as well be trying to police the ether. After four days of diplomatic wrangling over procedures, some 600 delegates from nations small and large got down to the nitty-gritty of setting the digital agenda for the first time. Cyberspace squabbles overshadowed the debate on a stack of proposals covering literary and artistic works, the rights of performers and producers of music and producers of databases. \"If it goes on like this, we wo n't have enough time to finish all the discussions,\" a frustrated Western delegate said. \"They announced they will start evening sessions next week.\" Attempts by copyright-based industries to ensure they get a cut from online works led to a storm of protests by Internet companies and critics who say the pacts would curb public access to online information from soccer results to stock prices. \"It's not illegal to make photocopies of newspaper articles. It's fair use. We can read sports statistics or stock prices. But with the treaty, this kind of fact will be owned and subject to licensing,\" said James Love, a consumer lobbyist heading the Washington-based Consumer Project on Technology. \"None of the treaties are ready to move. These people do n't understand what they're doing.\" At stake are billions of dollars and the future of the electronic information industry-- the coming medium for the distribution of music, films, literature, software and commerce. Supporters of the three pacts say they are only an extension of existing intellectual property rights, covered by the century-old Berne Convention. But an array of opponents from the network industry to consumer, scientific and academic groups say the pacts will give sweeping powers to entertainment and copyright-based industries. A quick survey at the conference centre found few officials who had actually surfed the Internet. Mongolia's state copyright official, Gundegma Jargalshaihan, said apologetically that he had just arrived from Ulan Bator and was not aware of the details of the digital agenda. \"We do n't have money for Internet in Mongolia,\" he added. Alexander Bavykin, deputy legal chief at Russia's foreign ministry, said Moscow had yet to formulate a policy on copyright in cybersppace. He too had never browsed the Net. \"I've never tried it and why should I? There are lots of other things in this life I have n't tried either,\" he said. A visit to the computer centre offering Internet services found a lone European official clicking away on his mouse. \"Internet is a potential cash cow for copyright-based industries and we need roadmaps on the information superhighway,\" said Marc Pearl, vice-president of the Information Technology Association of America, a trade association of U.S. network companies opposing the treaties. \"But there are a lot of dinosaurs here. People here do n't understand Internet technology. Because they do n't understand technology, they fear the unknown.\" Before the Internet, those whose business was to protect copyrights knew where they stood. Their enemies were tangible if elusive, such as the people who pirated music cassettes.

CINCINNATI 1996-08-31 Major league ERA leader Kevin Brown threw an eight-hitter and Devon White's RBI double snapped a fifth-inning tie as the Florida Marlins beat the Cincinnati Reds 3-1 for their seventh straight win Friday. Brown (14-10) tied Todd Stottlemyre of the Cardinals for the National League lead with his fifth complete game and lowered his major league-leading earned run average from 1.96 to 1.92. He struck out eight and did not walk a batter. Brown threw 119 pitches and won for the third time in as many starts against the Reds this season. \"Bolesy (Florida manager John Boles) told me yesterday, ' You have to go nine tomorrow, '\" Brown said. \"In the early innings, I was struggling, I was just trying to make it from pitch to pitch. I gave up a lot of hits in the early innings and I was n't thinking about the seventh, eighth or ninth. I was n't satisfied with any of my pitches and I did a better job of moving the ball around in the later innings.\" \"He has a devastating sinker,\" observed Reds manager Ray Knight. \"The guys say it moved more than everyone in the league. I remember Nolan Ryan saying in ' 91 or ' 92 that he was the best young pitcher coming around in a long time and he saw (Tom) Seaver and (Jerry) Koosman when they were starting.\" In Philadelphia, Delino DeShields's triple in the top of the 12th off Jeff Parrett (2-3) scored Chad Curtis and lifted the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 7-6 victory over the Phillies. Los Angeles won for the seventh time in eight games. Darren Dreifort (1-1) picked up the win after allowing a hit and a walk over 2 1/3 scoreless innings. Todd Worrell worked the 12th to earn his league-leading 37th save. The Phillies have dropped five of their last six overall, and nine of 11 at home. Billy Ashley belted a three-run homer for Los Angeles. In Chicago, the Braves and Cubs split a doubleheader. In the first game, Ryne Sandberg snapped an eighth-inning tie with an infield single and Kevin Foster (6-2) outdueled Atlanta's Tom Glavine (13-8) for his third straight win, 3-2. Foster, a.333 hitter, helped his own cause in the second with a two-run single. The Braves took the second game when Chipper Jones singled home the tying run in the top of the ninth and Andruw Jones took advantage of a poor throw to score the go-ahead run on a sacrifice fly for a 6-5 victory. Cubs shortstop Jose Hernandez committed three of Chicago's four errors. Mike Mordecai singled, doubled and homered for Atlanta, which has won 14 of its last 19 games and has the best record in the majors, 84-50. In Montreal, Scott Sanders allowed one hit over eight innings and Wally Joyner hit a two-run single in a four-run third as the San Diego Padres blanked the Expos 6-0 for their sixth straight win. Sanders (8-4) struck out 10 and walked three to win his fourth straight. He allowed a leadoff double to David Segui in the second, and won for the seventh time in eight decisions. The right-hander retired 14 batters in a row from the second inning through the seventh. Mike Oquist allowed one Montreal hit in the ninth. Montreal lost for the ninth time in 14 games. In New York, Marvin Benard's two-run homer snapped a tie and Shawn Estes came one out away from his first complete game as the San Francisco Giants beat the Mets 6-4. Benard, hitting.467 (14-for-30) against the Mets this season, hit his first pitch from Pete Harnisch (8-10) in the seventh over the right-field fence to put the Giants up 4-2. Estes (3-4) was lifted for closer Rod Beck after yielding a single with two out in the ninth. Beck allowed a two-run double to Alvaro Espinoza, who collected a career-high four RBI, but struck out Brent Mayne for his 31st save. The loss was the Mets ' eighth straight, their longest slide since September 1993, and dropped them to 0-4 under new manager Bobby Valentine. In St Louis, Tom Pagnozzi had three hits and three RBI and Alan Benes scattered six hits over six-plus innings as the Cardinals beat the Colorado Rockies 7-4. Benes (12-8) allowed three runs, walked three and struck out three for the win. St Louis defeated Colorado for just the second time in 12 meetings dating back to last season. Ray Lankford went 4-for-5 with a pair of doubles for the Cardinals, who won for just the third time in 11 games. Eric Anthony hit a pair of solo homers for the Rockies. In Pittsburgh, Sean Berry tied a career high with six RBI and Donne Wall fired a seven-hitter for his first major-league shutout as the Houston Astros routed the Pirates 10-0. It was the third time Berry had six RBI in one game. Wall (9-4) struck out four and walked none to post his second complete game of the season and third straight win.", "value": [{"start": 37, "end": 44, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins"}, {"start": 56, "end": 66, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati"}, {"start": 102, "end": 113, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Brown_(right-handed_pitcher)"}, {"start": 199, "end": 214, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins"}, {"start": 224, "end": 239, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds"}, {"start": 302, "end": 318, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Stottlemyre"}, {"start": 597, "end": 601, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds"}, {"start": 1068, "end": 1072, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds"}, {"start": 1161, "end": 1171, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Ryan"}, {"start": 1399, "end": 1411, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Parrett"}, {"start": 1425, "end": 1436, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Curtis"}, {"start": 1452, "end": 1471, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers"}, {"start": 1498, "end": 1507, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies"}, {"start": 1508, "end": 1519, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels_of_Anaheim"}, {"start": 1561, "end": 1576, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Dreifort"}, {"start": 1663, "end": 1675, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Worrell"}, {"start": 1734, "end": 1742, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Phillies"}, {"start": 1812, "end": 1824, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Ashley"}, {"start": 1870, "end": 1878, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"}, {"start": 1883, "end": 1889, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves"}, {"start": 1894, "end": 1898, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs"}, {"start": 1940, "end": 1953, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryne_Sandberg"}, {"start": 2049, "end": 2060, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Glavine"}, {"start": 2185, "end": 2191, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves"}, {"start": 2218, "end": 2231, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipper_Jones"}, {"start": 2287, "end": 2299, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andruw_Jones"}, {"start": 2395, "end": 2399, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs"}, {"start": 2467, "end": 2480, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Mordecai"}, {"start": 2610, "end": 2619, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal"}, {"start": 2673, "end": 2685, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_Joyner"}, {"start": 2734, "end": 2750, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres"}, {"start": 2907, "end": 2918, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Segui"}, {"start": 3096, "end": 3104, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Expos"}, {"start": 3123, "end": 3131, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Expos"}, {"start": 3230, "end": 3241, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Estes"}, {"start": 3296, "end": 3316, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants"}, {"start": 3423, "end": 3436, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Harnisch"}, {"start": 3497, "end": 3503, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants"}, {"start": 3512, "end": 3517, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Estes"}, {"start": 3546, "end": 3554, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Beck"}, {"start": 3709, "end": 3720, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Mayne"}, {"start": 3757, "end": 3761, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets"}, {"start": 3895, "end": 3907, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Pagnozzi"}, {"start": 3941, "end": 3951, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Benes"}, {"start": 4000, "end": 4009, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals"}, {"start": 4019, "end": 4035, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies"}, {"start": 4041, "end": 4046, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Benes"}, {"start": 4139, "end": 4147, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies"}, {"start": 4216, "end": 4228, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Lankford"}, {"start": 4329, "end": 4341, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Anthony"}, {"start": 4400, "end": 4410, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Berry"}, {"start": 4447, "end": 4457, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donne_Wall"}, {"start": 4521, "end": 4535, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros"}, {"start": 4547, "end": 4554, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates"}]}, {"text": "Italy evacuates 17 nuns and priests from Zaire.

Richard Finn NEW YORK 1996-08-30 Refusing to go quietly in the night, Stefan Edberg extended his stay at his 14th and last U.S. Open when Bernd Karbacher, trailing and hurting, quit in the fourth set of their second-round match Friday. The 30-year-old Edberg, a former two-time Open champion, had wrestled control of the match away from Karbacher when the German, hampered by a left hamstring injury, decided he could n't continue under the stadium lights at the National Tennis Centre. \"A win is a win. I'll take it,\" Edberg, who has announced that this will be his last Grand Slam event, said of the 3-6 6-3 6-3 1-0 victory. Ironically, Karbacher two years ago ended Ivan Lendl's Grand Slam career here when the former champion had to retire in the middle of their first-round match. After seeing the trainer come out early in the third set, Edberg was not surprised by Karbacher's decision not to go on. \"I knew he had problems with something,\" Edberg said. \"I really was n't surprised.\" Edberg had his own problems early in the match as the Swede battled to acclimate himself to the nighttime conditions while Karbacher was ripping passing shots and blasting serves past him. \"I did n't really feel good to begin with, I had problems finding the timing on the ball, seeing the ball,\" said Edberg, who upset Wimbledon champion and fifth-seeded Richard Krajicek in the first round. \"This was one of these matches where I did n't play up to my standard. I had to fight hard.\" Edberg's tenacity paid off in the second set. Edberg lost his own serve twice, but he rallied for three breaks of his own, the last to wrap up the set. \"That's where the match sort of changed,\" said Edberg. \"I think once I got that second set, I felt a lot better about my game.\" Edberg is starting to feel pretty good about postponing his swan song a lot longer. \"It does n't look all that bad,\" Edberg said of his path through the draw starting next with a match against Krajicek's Dutch countryman Paul Haarhuis. However, the 1991 and 1992 champion is not ready to start making plans to be in next week's final. \"I'm always being realistic,\" said Edberg. \"Like I said many times, I think it's a very little chance, but nothing is impossible.

Scotland, who thrashed Belarus 5-1 in their opening group four match, were unable to repeat their performance. Austria's best chance came in the 63rd minute with Stephan Marasek of SC Freiburg taking advantage of a scramble in the Scottish penalty area but his shot narrowly passing the left-hand post. They also went close a minute before the interval when a promising attack saw the ball fall to Markus Schopp but he hit his shot wide. Everton's Duncan Ferguson went close for Scotland in the 65th minute when he forced Austrian goalkeeper Michael Konsel to a diving save. Two Scotland players were shown yellow cards, captain Gary McAllister for bringing down Andreas Heraf and Ferguson for arguing against the referee's decision. \"The result is acceptable,\" Scottish coach Craig Brown told reporters. \"We'd hoped not to lose and we tried not to play for a draw but the Austrian defence was simply too good.\" SK Rapid's Dietmar Kuehbauer, who gave an impressive performance, said the team started off well but let the game slip after the first 30 minutes. \"Somehow it seemed there were less than 11 players on the pitch. We have lost two points. The Scots are not really a great team and we should have won,\" he said.

The victory extended to 29 matches France's unbeaten run under coach Aime Jacquet, their Euro 96 semifinal elimination having come in a penalty shoot-out, but was marred by the sending-off of Chelsea central defender Franck Leboeuf. Leboeuf was dismissed two minutes from time for a second bookable offence, fouling Mexican substitute Ricardo Pelaez who minutes earlier had also been shown the yellow card for pushing the Chelsea defender in the back. Both goals came early in the second half after France had surprised the Mexicans with three half-time substitutions. After a sterile first half, France injected more sting in midfield with the introduction of Juventus's Zinedine Zidane. This allowed Djorkaeff to play further up and his cross from the right fell for Ouedec, who has joined Espanyol of Barcelona from Nantes since missing the European championship finals through injury, to score after a mistake by midfielder Joaquin del Olmo. Within four minutes Ouedec was returning the compliment for Djorkaeff, playing a one-two with the Internazionale Milan forward down the middle to set him up for a cross shot past diving goalkeeper Osvaldo Sanchez.

Bert Lauwers BRUSSELS 1996-08-31 Belgium kicked off their 1998 World Cup campaign with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over 10-man Turkey in a tense match marred by Turkish crowd trouble shortly after the break. Turkish fans, upset at their team's 2-0 first-half deficit, ripped apart dozens of plastic seats and threw them over the fence. Riot police took 10 minutes to restore order. The police were given an unexpected hand by second-half substitute Sergen Yalcin who rekindled Turkish hopes in the 61st with a splendid half-volley which stunned Belgian goalkeeper Filip De Wilde. But Yalcin, who had come on just four minutes earlier, turned from hero to villain barely two minutes after his strike when he was sent off after spitting at an opponent and arguing with English referee David Elleray. Marc Degryse had opened the scoring for Belgium after 13 minutes, whacking a low 10-metre drive into the net after an incisive pass by defender Dirk Medved from the edge of the penalty area. Brazilian-born Luis Oliveira then gleefully slipped the ball past goalkeeper Rustu Recber from the right of the area to make it 2-0 seven minutes before the interval, Turkey's best first-half effort proving to be a vicious 30-metre shot by Ogun Temizkanoglu which De Wilde tipped over. The visitors, seeking to restore some pride after failing to score a single goal in Euro 96 in June, repeatedly ripped through the left side of the home defence but De Wilde was able to block several sharply-angled efforts. With only the group seven winners qualifying automatically for the 1998 finals in France, Belgium could not afford a slip-up at home and they frantically chased a decisive third goal. But they were almost upset 12 minutes from time when De Wilde fumbled a hard Arif Erdem shot and Orhan Cikirikci almost pounced on the loose ball. Belgium's best second-half effort came three minutes later when Degryse put the ball over the bar from close range with Recber beaten.

Clarke denied on Thursday he had threatened to resign and said his position on the single currency was in tune with that of Prime Minister John Major.

Accordingly, they demand an open investigation.

Blair once pledged to set up a Scottish parliament if the Labour won the next general election, which must be held by May 1997.

Another source said most of the key negotiators from both Bre-X and Barrick had returned to Toronto, but declined to say if there had been any progress in their negotiations. Both sources said Bre-X and Barrick did not hold talks on Thursday with Mines and Energy Ministry Secretary-General Umar Said, who is coordinating the negotiations over the Busang find in East Kalimantan. The first source also said Bre-X had until December 21 to submit to the Indonesian Mines and Energy Ministry a feasibility study on the central region of the Busang property, estimated to contain 2.6 million ounces of gold. The richest parts of the property to the north and south of the central region have been estimated by Bre-X to contain 57 million ounces of gold. \"Bre-X is expected to complete the feasibility report by December 16 and submit it to the government before the December 21 deadline,\" the source said. He said Bre-X would then formally seek the permission of the Indonesian government to begin construction to develop Busang's central region, which might take up to two years. The source declined to say if there had been any progress in the talks between Bre-X and Barrick. \"This is a huge project... we are not selling furniture, and Bre-X has 13,000 shareholders to answer to,\" the source said. \"While there has been some agreement in principle on some issues, there are still others such as procedures and mechanisms that needed to be sorted out,\" he added. The source said no new deadline had been set by the Mines and Energy Ministry for Bre-X and Barrick to strike a deal. The Ministry had given the companies until December 4 to complete a partnership deal, and advised Bre-X to take a 25 percent stake and Barrick 75 percent to develop the property. \"As far as I am aware, there's been no new deadline,\" the source said. The Ministry's Umar said on Thursday that both Bre-X and Barrick had responded positively to a government letter recommending a 25-75 split in the Busang gold property.

Some right-wingers demanded sovereignty in their own territory in the run-up to the elections, saying the alternative was war. Their threats came to nothing.

Ramthan Hussain SINGAPORE 1996-12-06 Singapore's winning campaign to host the World Trade Organisation (WTO)'s first ministerial meeting reflected its ambition to play a key role in shaping global free trade, the lifeblood of its economy, analysts said. \"As one of the world's most externally oriented economies, Singapore has a disproportionately large stake in the WTO,\" said Desmond Supple, economist at research house I.D.E.A. \"Singapore stands to benefit more than most from continued global trade liberalisation as trade is the engine of its growth, accounting for nearly three times its gross domestic product.\" The city-state met U.S. opposition two years ago in its bid to host the meeting, expected to gather 4,000 officials from 160 countries from December 9 to 13. In a stand some analysts linked to controversy over Singapore's caning of an American teenager for vandalism, then-U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor had said the meeting ought to be held where the WTO was going to be headquartered. That would have meant Geneva. But Singapore had the support of other WTO members. Derek da Cunha, senior fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies (ISEAS), said Singapore's hosting of the conference \"carries a great deal of symbolism for the city-state, underscoring its commitment to free trade and its trading links across the globe.\" There is the international prestige Singapore would enjoy, but \"more importantly there is a genuine national interest in fostering better global free trade and an open market\", said Tan Kong Yam, head of Business Policy at the National University of Singapore. At the ministerial meeting, trade ministers will review the work of the WTO and the implementation of the Uruguay Round free trade commitments under its predecessor the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). In June, the WTO hailed Singapore for its open market policies but the European Union and other trading powers called on Singapore to speed up the opening of its services sector. Supple said the struggle that Singapore had to wage in vying to host the meeting would be repeated during the talks. \"There is tension at every step of the way,\" since a battle line between the West and developing countries has been drawn over the issue of linking trade liberalisation with labour rights, he said. Supple said hosting the meeting carried prestige for Singapore, \"however, this is quite intangible as the prestige factor may not necessarily lead to any additional investment and trade flows to this region.\" From a commercial point of view, the meeting would be good for Singapore's tourism industry, Tan said. A large part of Singapore's workforce would be mobilised to ensure the meeting would run without a glitch but the average Singaporean \"would probably not be too concerned about some of the issues,\" Tan said. \"But the more educated public will realise that these kind of things are important for Singapore as a small economy.\" Supple said any political gains the Singapore government would get from the WTO meeting-- ahead of a general election due by April 1997-- would depend on how successful it was in pushing its economic agenda. \"If there are any movements toward freer trade, then Singapore's economy and the electorate would gain,\" he said. \"But I do n't think it would be wise to play up the political aspect of this. I think political issues will take secondary importance to all these economic issues that will be displayed.\"", "value": [{"start": 10, "end": 19, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 45, "end": 49, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"}, {"start": 128, "end": 139, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"}, {"start": 128, "end": 152, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"}, {"start": 363, "end": 372, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 688, "end": 692, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 904, "end": 912, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 968, "end": 981, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Kantor"}, {"start": 1030, "end": 1033, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"}, {"start": 1087, "end": 1094, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva"}, {"start": 1099, "end": 1108, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 1134, "end": 1137, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"}, {"start": 1438, "end": 1447, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 1735, "end": 1738, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"}, {"start": 1892, "end": 1895, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"}, {"start": 1903, "end": 1912, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 1950, "end": 1964, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"start": 2000, "end": 2009, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 2088, "end": 2097, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 2807, "end": 2818, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 2980, "end": 2989, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 3087, "end": 3090, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"}]}, {"text": "Rwandan refugee group calls for calm over census.

Liutauras Stremaitis URUS-MARTAN, Russia 1996-08-31 Crowds of pro-independence Chechens greeted a newly-signed peace deal by singing, dancing and firing guns in the air on Saturday, but the celebrations held a trace of uncertainty. More than a thousand women, children and men gathered in a field to the north of the town of Urus-Martan on Saturday to wait for a column of rebels to withdraw from the capital Grozny about 25 km (12 miles) away. The men fired weapons into the air as groups of women danced. Adults in the crowd carried posters of former Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev-- who declared independence in 1991-- and children, carrying photographs of him, called \"Troops out!\". Russian military officials have expressed fears that the rebels and their supporters will see the deal signed by Russian peace envoy Alexander Lebed in the early hours of Saturday as a military victory for the separatists. It involves the withdrawal of Russian troops sent to Chechnya in December 1994 to crush the separatists and a postponement of the issue at the heart of the conflict-- the status of the mainly-Moslem North Caucasus region. But the people in the crowd on Saturday, who had turned out in support of the rebels, did not seem sure that the war was over. \"We hope for the best, that it really has ended so we can live in peace. It's our only dream,\" said a 30-year-old woman, Mubatik Dagayeva. Aiza Dudayeva, with her 10-year-old son beside her, shared the guarded optimism. \"We really want the war to end, we hope and believe that our sons and brothers will win,\" said Dudayeva, adding that she was from Urus-Martan. Urus-Martan is a traditionally anti-separatist pocket in Chechnya and Moscow-backed leader Doku Zavgayev, who has been sidelined in the peace deal, has warned that it and places like it could become centres of civil war if Russian troops leave. But on Saturday the people gathered just outside the town seemed to be united in favour of the separatists. Two columns of rebels appeared in jeeps and cars, firing their guns in the air, as the crowd rushed towards them. Mouldi Mamatuyev, in his late 20's, dressed in black and carrying a machine gun, was welcomed by his mother and sister. \"Two sons have come back,\" said his mother Nurbika Mamatuyeva. \"It's the end. We believe in God.\" Mamatuyev joked that his sister Lisa was a rebel too, and she responded by grabbing hold of his gun and shouting the Chechen war cry \"Allahu Akhbar\" (God is Greatest) and \"Freedom for Chechnya!\". The fighter, sitting next to a man dressed in green and carrying a grenade-launcher, said that the strict Islamic law adopted by the rebels during the conflict was now needed to impose peace. \"The war has ended if everything works out, if there is law there will be power.

WARSAW 1996-08-31 A Polish consortium including the Bank Rozwoju Exportu SA (BRE) plans to rival France's Hachette in bidding for Polish state-owned press distribution chain Ruch SA, Zycie Warszawy daily said on Saturday. Zycie Warszawy said its own publisher, mineral water firm Multico, and a group headed by Polish businessman Zygmunt Solorz were forming a consortium which would offer about $ 120 million, with finance provided by BRE. The consortium wanted 40 percent of Ruch's shares, the state would get 20 percent of Ruch and 40 percent would be offered on the Warsaw stock exchange. \"This division would guarantee a dispersal of capital, preventing anyone from taking total control over Ruch and dictating market conditions,\" the paper quoted one of the initiators of the move as saying, without giving a name. A consortium of press distributor Hachette and Polish publishers group UWP are seeking more than than 50 percent of Ruch and French President Jacques Chirac is likely to support its case when he visits Poland in September, the daily said. News-stand chain Ruch, which controls about 65 percent of Poland's press distribution market, had a net profit of 16.2 million zlotys on sales of 2.7 billion zlotys in 1995. It has about 17,000 news-stands and was the country's sole press distributor before the 1989 fall of communism. Zycie Warszawy said the new, open consortium, which also included several listed Polish firms, would on Monday inform Privatisation Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek of its plans. It aims to invest $ 200 million in Ruch over five years-- more than the sum Ruch says it needs to upgrade its outlets. Initially Poland offered up to 75 percent of Ruch but in March Kaczmarek cancelled the tender and offered a minority stake with an option to increase the equity. Two consortia-- UWP-Hachette and a consortium of a Polish SPC group and Swiss firms-- placed initial bids. But after the change of tender conditions Swiss investors pulled out and SPC decided to bid jointly with UWP-Hachette. Kaczmarek said in May he was unhappy that only one investor ended up bidding for Ruch, in which the government was initially offering up to 35 percent of shares with an option to extend the holding after investment promises are fulfilled.-- Anthony Barker+48 22 653 9700", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 6, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 54, "end": 60, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw"}, {"start": 74, "end": 80, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 184, "end": 190, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 365, "end": 371, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 623, "end": 629, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw"}, {"start": 921, "end": 927, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 945, "end": 948, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Workers'_Party_(Dominica)"}, {"start": 999, "end": 1005, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"start": 1076, "end": 1082, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 1399, "end": 1413, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u017bycie_Warszawy"}, {"start": 1480, "end": 1486, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 1701, "end": 1707, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 1904, "end": 1910, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 1925, "end": 1930, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"}, {"start": 2002, "end": 2007, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"}]}, {"text": "ALPINE SKIING-WOMEN'S WORLD CUP SUPER G RESULTS.

MANILA 1996-08-31 The detention of veteran dissident Wang Donghai showed China's determination to crush any vestige of dissent during the current profound transitions in the nation's leadership, a human rights activist said on Saturday. Xiao Qiang, executive director of the New York-based group Human Rights in China, said Wang's arrest on Friday appeared to be part of the national \"Strike Hard\" campaign that has imprisoned thousands and sent hundreds to their death. Although supposedly aimed at criminals, dozens of human rights activists have been detained in the campaign, which is meant to strengthen the Communist Party's grip on power as senior leader Deng Xiaoping nears death, Xiao said in an interview. \"China is going through this power transition period. The authorities are apparently extremely afraid of any political and social discontent,\" said Xiao, in Manila to attend an Amnesty International conference on human rights in China. He said one of Wang's apparent offences was to write a public letter in May suggesting that a free press and an independent judicial system were vital if the government really meant to stamp out rampant corruption. Xiao said crushing legitimate dissent was only making the problem worse and one day China would pay a high price. \"Those issues are not going to go away by repression. You only make things more hidden but potentially more explosive,\" he said. Wang was arrested in the east China city of Hangzhou by security officers who told the dissident's family he would be sent to a study class-- a euphemism for coercive ideological reform. Wang, 45, was sentenced last month to one year's \"re-education by labour\" but was released because of ill-health. Xiao said conditions in the labour camp were so brutal they drove another activist sentenced with Wang to attempt suicide. Police beat Wang and his colleague, Chen Longde, and encouraged other camp inmates to attack them as well, Xiao said.", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 5, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"}, {"start": 713, "end": 726, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping"}, {"start": 996, "end": 1002, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"}, {"start": 1302, "end": 1307, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"}, {"start": 1491, "end": 1496, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"}, {"start": 1505, "end": 1513, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou"}]}, {"text": "ALPINE SKIING-WOMEN'S WORLD CUP DOWNHILL RESULTS.

Deborah Charles RANGOON 1996-08-31 Burma's democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi hit out at the government on Saturday for recent arrests and jailing of activists, saying the military abused the law to try to crush the democracy movement. \"The main purpose of this press conference is to make it known to the world that the authorities are misusing the law all the time in order to try to crush the democracy movement,\" Suu Kyi told reporters at her Rangoon home. Suu Kyi said at least 61 democracy supporters had been arrested since May, and about 30 of them had been sentenced, most to long prison terms. In May the government launched a sweeping crackdown on the democracy movement, detaining over 260 members of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) ahead of a party congress. Most were released but several dozen remain in custody. The Burmese government last week confirmed the recent sentencing of nine democracy activists who were arrested in the May crackdown, including Suu Kyi's assistant Win Htein. The military government, which in May said it had detained the politicians to prevent anarchy, said the activists were charged with attempting to destroy the peace and stability of the state. But Suu Kyi disagreed with the methods, saying officials often arrested NLD supporters in the middle of the night, then did not give them the opportunity to defend themselves in trials. \"When our people are tried, they are tried in a very secretive way. Their families are not told,\" she said. Suu Kyi, who spearheads a campaign for sanctions on Burma's government, was under house arrest for six years without being tried before being released in July 1995. Several other leading members of the NLD have served prison terms. The NLD party won a landslide victory in a 1990 election but the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), which assumed power in 1988 after crushing pro-democracy demonstrations, never recognised the poll. \"This lack of rule of law is an indication that the authorities are not interested in fair play,\" she said. \"They are using a travesty of the law to try and crush our movements and to sentence our people to long terms in prison without proper trial.\" Suu Kyi said once the activists were sentenced, they suffered inhuman conditions and lack of rights in prison. \"Almost all of the prisoners start suffering from various health problems after a couple of years in jail,\" she said. \"Some of our people have been in prison for five to six years.\" Most political prisoners are held in Rangoon's Insein Prison. Some who have been released have recounted torture methods like sleep and food deprivation and physical abuse. \"If there are any more instances of death in custody it will be further proof that a prison sentence for political prisoners is sometimes almost the same as a death sentence,\" Suu Kyi said. Hla Than, an elected member of parliament for the NLD, died in early August after being at Insein for six years. His death came five weeks after James Leander (Leo) Nichols, a close friend of Suu Kyi and Danish honorary consul, died while serving a prison term at Insein. Suu Kyi said the government had increased its repression tactics on the democracy movement because it feared the growing popularity of the movement. But she said she and the NLD would not stop their efforts to bring democracy to Burma even if it meant more arrests of party members or even herself. \"We will carry on. Nobody is free from arrest in Burma.\"", "value": [{"start": 8, "end": 15, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 108, "end": 124, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 464, "end": 471, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 494, "end": 501, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon"}, {"start": 508, "end": 515, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 893, "end": 900, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma"}, {"start": 1259, "end": 1266, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 1601, "end": 1608, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma"}, {"start": 2246, "end": 2253, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 2308, "end": 2326, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhuman_Conditions"}, {"start": 2576, "end": 2585, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon"}, {"start": 2888, "end": 2895, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 3094, "end": 3101, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 3106, "end": 3112, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"}, {"start": 3174, "end": 3181, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 3403, "end": 3408, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma"}]}, {"text": "ALPINE SKIING-GOETCHL WINS WORLD CUP DOWNHILL.

DETROIT 1996-08-31 Automakers, suppliers, insurers and the federal government's auto safety agency Saturday launched a $ 10 million safety awareness campaign aimed at reducing the number of children killed accidentally by air bags in cars and trucks. Officials said they will work with law enforcement agencies, pediatricians and media to warn parents about the dangers that air bags pose to children and adults not wearing seatbelts. Since 1993, 24 children have been killed by the explosive force of automotive air bags, which inflate at speeds up to 200 miles per hour. The first portion of the campaign involves pickup trucks equipped with billboards that were driving along some of the nation's busiest interstate highways during the Labor Day weekend, including Interstate 95 on the East Coast, Interstates 80 and 90 in the Midwest and Interstate 5 in California. The boards read : \"Air Bag Safety : Everyone Buckled, Kids in Back.\" Janet Dewey, executive director of the industry-funded National Automobile Occupant Protection Campaign, said most of the injuries to children occurred because they were not wearing seatbelts. A child's chances of being killed in a car accident, whether the vehicle was equipped with an air bag or not, is reduced by 29 percent when they are in the rear seat, she said. The auto industry was about three to six years away from introducing \"smart\" air bags with the ability to detect the size and position of an occupant and adjust inflation pressures accordingly. Current air bags were designed to halt the forward momentum of an average-sized, unbelted adult male, not a small child. Automakers petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to allow them to introduce air bags that inflate less aggressively to help reduce unwanted injuries. \"Even if changes are made to airbags today, we'd still have 20 million vehicles on the road with current technology,\" Dewey said. \"The public has n't been getting the message.\"", "value": [{"start": 12, "end": 16, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 49, "end": 56, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit"}, {"start": 1965, "end": 1970, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_E._Dewey"}]}, {"text": "SOCCER - SCOTTISH PREMIER DIVISION SUMMARIES.

They said 200 fighter planes, including 79 on the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson, were already in the Gulf ; the aircraft carrier Enterprise was in the eastern Mediterranean with 79 more, and an air expeditionary force with up to 40 more was ready to fly from the United States if ordered. \"Yesterday the president ordered the Department of Defense to take prudent planning steps to have forces ready to deploy to the region should he direct us to do so,\" Pentagon spokesman Doug Kennett said. \"We have taken those prudent planning steps.\" Clinton said on Saturday he had ordered U.S. forces in the Gulf to go on high alert and was reinforcing them in response to Iraqi attacks on Kurdish dissidents in northern Iraq. \"These developments... cause me grave concern,\" Clinton said at a campaign stop in Troy, Tennessee. But he added, \"It is premature at this time, and I want to emphasize that, highly premature to speculate on any response we might have.\" The U.S. defense officials said military flights to enforce no-fly zones in both northern and southern Iraq doubled over the weekend. Clinton said Iraqi military forces overran the city of Arbil, which has been held since 1994 by Kurdish rebels who Baghdad says are backed by Iran. There were unconfirmed reports that Iran had sent troops into northern Iraq in response to Iraq's attack. U.S. plans rely heavily on U.S. air attacks on Iraqi forces, but there are also 23,000 U.S. troops in the region, according to defense officials. In addition to the 158 F / A-18, F-14 and other fighter planes on the aircraft carriers Vinson and Enterprise, the Air Force air expeditionary force of 30 to 40 F-15 and F-16 fighter planes and fuel tankers is ready to fly from three U.S. bases in the United States, they said. The expeditionary force would include nearly 1,000 Air Force personnel in ground and support crews, they said. The 23,000 U.S. military people already in the Gulf consist of 15,000 sailors and Marines, 6,000 U.S. servicemen based primarily in Saudi Arabia and 2,000 U.S. troops in the area for military exercises.

A spokesman said he could substantially confirm a report in the news weekly Der Spiegel, which said Iranian secret police burst in while attache Jens Gust was entertaining six Iranian writers and their wives. Gust was threatened with violence, then locked into a room to be interrogated on suspicion of \"promoting activities hostile to the state\" while his guests were taken away, the magazine said. The ministry spokesman said the German embassy immediately made a sharp protest to the Tehran government. The Iranian ambassador was also summoned to the ministry in Bonn to hear a sharp protest and \"disapproval of this glaring breach of the principles of international law\", he added. Iran subsequently said it regretted the incident, which it said had been the result of a misunderstanding. All those detained appeared to have been freed, the spokesman said. Relations between the two countries are currently under strain because of the testimony in a Berlin court of former Iranian president Abolhassan Banisadr. Banisadr, an avowed opponent of the Tehran government who now lives in exile, accused top Iranian leaders of personally ordering the assassination of three exiled Kurdish leaders in a Berlin restaurant in 1992. Iran has asked Germany to extradite Banisadr, who is due is due back in Berlin next Thursday to continue his testimony.

If Germany were to extradite him, he said, it would \"lose face before the whole world\".

Vera Haller VENICE, Italy 1996-08-31 Dublin-born director Neil Jordan says he never lost more sleep over a film than over \"Michael Collins\", his controversial epic about the IRA which has its premiere on Saturday at the Venice Film Festival. The film, starring Liam Neeson and Julia Roberts, recounts the life of Michael Collins, the Irish Republican Army's Director of Intelligence who fought for Irish independence from 1919 to 1921. Although not due for release in Britain until early next year, some politicians have already said they feared it would fan sectarian tensions in British-ruled Northern Ireland. Jordan defends his decision to make the film, whose screenplay he wrote himself after years of research, saying it was \"more about history than any political statement\". \"The film spares neither the Irish nor the British in its depiction of the savagery of the time,\" Jordan said in a statement released by Warner Bros. \"How often has independence been achieved without bloodshed? Very rarely.\" Jordan, whose 1992 film \"The Crying Game\" also came under fire for what was perceived as a sympathetic portrayal of the IRA, said Collins was more than just a revolutionary. \"He developed techniques of guerilla warfare later copied by independence movements around the world, from Mao Tse-Tung in China to Yitzak Shamir in Israel,\" Jordan said. \"Collins would never be a proponent of contemporary terrorism as practised today. He was a soldier and a statesman and, over time, a man of peace.\" Leeson, the Northern Ireland-born actor who was nominated for an Oscar for best actor for his performance in \"Schindler's List\", plays the lead role in Jordan's film. Aidan Quinn portrays Harry Boland, Collins ' best friend, and rival for the love of Kitty Kiernan, played by Roberts. Much of the film was shot on location in Dublin with Jordan using thousands of its citizens as unpaid extras. A set, however, was used for the fighting scenes. Noting that information about Collins was \"as mysterious as the existence he maintained\", Jordan said he made some historical assumptions in the film. \"I have made choices about certain events based on my own extensive research into his letters and reported speeches,\" he said. \"I wanted to make this a story as accurate as possible without killing it dramatically and I think I have. It is a very true film.\" One of the assumptions is his interpretation of the murky circumstances surrounding the shooting death of Collins, who had broken with his comrades when he sought a negotiated settlement with Britain, in an ambush in 1922. \"I have never lost more sleep over the making of a film than I have over ' Michael Collins ', but I'll never make a more important one,\" Jordan said. \"In the life of one person you can tell the events that formed the north and south of Ireland as they are today.\"", "value": [{"start": 14, "end": 17, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army"}, {"start": 35, "end": 41, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice"}, {"start": 72, "end": 77, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"}, {"start": 110, "end": 121, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Jordan"}, {"start": 272, "end": 278, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice"}, {"start": 313, "end": 324, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Neeson"}, {"start": 450, "end": 455, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland"}, {"start": 520, "end": 527, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 864, "end": 869, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland"}, {"start": 878, "end": 885, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 933, "end": 939, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan"}, {"start": 1180, "end": 1184, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army"}, {"start": 1357, "end": 1362, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"}, {"start": 1366, "end": 1379, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Shamir"}, {"start": 1392, "end": 1398, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan"}, {"start": 1879, "end": 1885, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin"}, {"start": 1891, "end": 1897, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Grand_Prix"}, {"start": 2600, "end": 2608, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 2858, "end": 2874, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland"}, {"start": 2867, "end": 2874, "tag": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland"}]}, {"text": "SOCCER - REINSTATED ALBANIA NAMES SQUAD TO PLAY N.IRELAND.

After going four up in the first 55 minutes South Korea allowed Indonesia, newcomers to Asian Cup finals, back into the match, conceding two goals from rare counter attacks. Kim Do Hoon opened the scoring for South Korea in only the fifth minute, turning unmarked on the penalty spot to fire a shot into the top corner. It looked like turning into a rout as Hwang Sun Hong rapidly added two more in the seventh and 15th minutes but although the Koreans continued to dominate they failed to add to the score before the interval. But they started the second half where they had left off and it was not long before they went four up, Ko Jeong Woon heading in from a free kick in the 55th minute. The Koreans then appeared to relax, allowing the Indonesians to get back into the match. Ronny Wabia scored for Indonesia three minutes later direct from a a corner kick that Korean goalkeeper Kim Byung reached with one hand but failed to keep out. With 65 minutes gone Indonesia's Widodo Putra, who scored a spectacular goal against Kuwait on Wednesday, was again on target, breaking through the Korean defence to beat the keeper with a low shot.

It all culminated in the fact that I now have lots of great, great friends in Ireland. That is why this is so emotional a night for me,\" Charlton said. \"It was the joy that we all had over the period, that I shared with people that I grew to love, that I treasure most,\" he added. Charlton managed Ireland for 93 matches, during which time they lost only 17 times in almost 10 years until he resigned in December 1995. He guided Ireland to two successive World Cup finals tournaments and to the 1988 European championship finals in Germany, after the Irish beat a well-fancied England team 1-0 in their group qualifier.
