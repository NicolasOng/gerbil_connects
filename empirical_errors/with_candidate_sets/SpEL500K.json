LONDON 1996-08-30 West Indian all-rounder Phil Simmons took four for 38 on Friday as Leicestershire beat Somerset by an innings and 39 runs in two days to take over at the head of the county championship. Their stay on top, though, may be short-lived as title rivals Essex, Derbyshire and Surrey all closed in on victory while Kent made up for lost time in their rain-affected match against Nottinghamshire. After bowling Somerset out for 83 on the opening morning at Grace Road, Leicestershire extended their first innings by 94 runs before being bowled out for 296 with England discard Andy Caddick taking three for 83. Trailing by 213, Somerset got a solid start to their second innings before Simmons stepped in to bundle them out for 174. Essex, however, look certain to regain their top spot after Nasser Hussain and Peter Such gave them a firm grip on their match against Yorkshire at Headingley. Hussain, considered surplus to England's one-day requirements, struck 158, his first championship century of the season, as Essex reached 372 and took a first innings lead of 82. By the close Yorkshire had turned that into a 37-run advantage but off-spinner Such had scuttled their hopes, taking four for 24 in 48 balls and leaving them hanging on 119 for five and praying for rain. At the Oval, Surrey captain Chris Lewis, another man dumped by England, continued to silence his critics as he followed his four for 45 on Thursday with 80 not out on Friday in the match against Warwickshire. He was well backed by England hopeful Mark Butcher who made 70 as Surrey closed on 429 for seven, a lead of 234. Derbyshire kept up the hunt for their first championship title since 1936 by reducing Worcestershire to 133 for five in their second innings, still 100 runs away from avoiding an innings defeat. Australian Tom Moody took six for 82 but Chris Adams, 123, and Tim O'Gorman, 109, took Derbyshire to 471 and a first innings lead of 233. After the frustration of seeing the opening day of their match badly affected by the weather, Kent stepped up a gear to dismiss Nottinghamshire for 214. They were held up by a gritty 84 from Paul Johnson but ex-England fast bowler Martin McCague took four for 55. By stumps Kent had reached 108 for three.", "value": [{"start": 10, "end": 24, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicestershire_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 65, "end": 71, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London"}, {"start": 83, "end": 94, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team"}, {"start": 107, "end": 119, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Simmons"}, {"start": 150, "end": 164, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicestershire_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 170, "end": 178, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 332, "end": 337, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 339, "end": 349, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derbyshire_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 354, "end": 360, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 392, "end": 396, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 456, "end": 471, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottinghamshire_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 487, "end": 495, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 533, "end": 543, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Road"}, {"start": 545, "end": 559, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicestershire_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 637, "end": 644, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team"}, {"start": 653, "end": 665, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Caddick"}, {"start": 704, "end": 712, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 762, "end": 769, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Simmons"}, {"start": 809, "end": 814, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 869, "end": 883, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasser_Hussain"}, {"start": 888, "end": 898, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Such"}, {"start": 944, "end": 953, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 957, "end": 967, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headingley_Stadium"}, {"start": 969, "end": 976, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasser_Hussain"}, {"start": 1000, "end": 1007, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team"}, {"start": 1093, "end": 1098, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essex_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 1161, "end": 1170, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 1355, "end": 1363, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oval"}, {"start": 1365, "end": 1371, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 1380, "end": 1391, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lewis_(cricketer)"}, {"start": 1415, "end": 1422, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team"}, {"start": 1547, "end": 1559, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwickshire_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 1583, "end": 1590, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team"}, {"start": 1599, "end": 1611, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Butcher"}, {"start": 1627, "end": 1633, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 1674, "end": 1684, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derbyshire_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 1760, "end": 1774, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcestershire_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 1869, "end": 1879, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team"}, {"start": 1880, "end": 1889, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Moody"}, {"start": 1910, "end": 1921, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Adams_(cricketer)"}, {"start": 1956, "end": 1966, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derbyshire_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 2101, "end": 2105, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 2135, "end": 2150, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottinghamshire_County_Cricket_Club"}, {"start": 2198, "end": 2210, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Johnson_(squash_player)"}, {"start": 2238, "end": 2252, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_McCague"}, {"start": 2281, "end": 2285, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_County_Cricket_Club"}]}, {"text": "( Reuters ) - Breakdancing cleared its final hurdle to feature in the Paris 2024 Games on Monday , bringing the wholly original , electric art form to sport \u2019s biggest stage . Slideshow ( 2 images ) Considered one of the pillars of hip-hop culture , breaking , as participants prefer to call it , originated in New York in the 1970s and has spread globally , enjoying enormous popularity beyond the United States and particularly across Europe and Asia . A 2019 Olympic Programme Commission Report estimated there were roughly one million participants in breaking worldwide and the 2019 Red Bull BC One World Final in Mumbai racked up more than 50 million views across streaming platforms including Facebook and YouTube . \u201c It can resonate with a lot of people because hip-hop culture resonates with a lot of people , hip-hop music resonates with a lot of people , \u201d Logan Edra , a 17-year-old American dancer who goes by the performance name Logistx and has performed on The Ellen DeGeneres Show , told Reuters . Breaking is not the first artistic movement counted as an Olympic sport but its inclusion in the Paris 2024 Games has prompted soul-searching among many dancers , including Edra , a former gymnast who aspires to win the Olympic gold . \u201c It being in the Olympics , it makes sense that people would refer to it as ( a sport ) but I think one thing for the breaking community is we want to make sure that it \u2019s not known as just a sport but an art , a sport , a culture , \u201d said Edra , who won the 2018 Silverback Open Championship B-Girl solo competition . Key elements in breaking include top rocks -- typically a competitor \u2019s introductory dance moves -- footwork , power moves and freezes . Power moves are explosive displays such as spins , while freezes are when a performer sticks a pose . In a blend of artistry and athleticism , competitors -- known as \u201c b-boys \u201d and \u201c b-girls \u201d -- are evaluated not only on technical skill but also creativity and style , with strength , speed , rhythm and agility providing an edge . \u201c The biggest part is your stage presence and character and your rhythm , whether or not you \u2019re really feeling it , \u201d said Ronnie Abaldonado , a competitive breaker since 2004 who won the international Red Bull BC One competition in 2007 . \u201c People can hit the moves but if you \u2019re not feeling what they \u2019re doing then you just kind of look robotic and that \u2019s what kind of separates it being a sport to it being an art form . \u201d Richard \u201c Crazy Legs \u201d Colon , one of the pioneers during his upbringing in the Bronx in the 1970s , said he applauded breaking \u2019s inclusion in the Olympics but wanted to ensure its cultural core remained intact . \u201c This is true folk art from the music to the dance , to the DJ to the rapper , \u201d said Colon , who appeared in dance films of the 1980s including Beat Street and Flashdance . \u201c We \u2019 ve already legitimized ourselves so we \u2019re not looking to the Olympics for legitimacy . \u201d The Olympic competition will take place in the heart of Paris , on the Place de la Concorde , at the bottom of the famed Champs-Elysees . \u201c It will be a fascinating mix of sports and culture at an iconic site , \u201d Paris 2024 sports director Jean-Philippe Gatien told reporters on Monday . \u201c We \u2019re expecting it to be a phenomenal success . \u201d", "value": [{"start": 2, "end": 9, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 70, "end": 86, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Summer_Olympics"}, {"start": 232, "end": 239, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop"}, {"start": 311, "end": 319, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City"}, {"start": 399, "end": 412, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 437, "end": 443, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"}, {"start": 448, "end": 452, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia"}, {"start": 618, "end": 624, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai"}, {"start": 699, "end": 707, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"start": 712, "end": 719, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube"}, {"start": 769, "end": 776, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop"}, {"start": 818, "end": 831, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music"}, {"start": 894, "end": 902, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 972, "end": 996, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ellen_DeGeneres_Show"}, {"start": 1004, "end": 1011, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 1072, "end": 1079, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_sports"}, {"start": 1111, "end": 1127, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Summer_Olympics"}, {"start": 1234, "end": 1241, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Summer_Olympics"}, {"start": 1267, "end": 1275, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Summer_Olympics"}, {"start": 2243, "end": 2258, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_BC_One"}, {"start": 2546, "end": 2555, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx"}, {"start": 2830, "end": 2841, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_Street"}, {"start": 2846, "end": 2856, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashdance"}, {"start": 3012, "end": 3017, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris"}, {"start": 3027, "end": 3047, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_de_la_Concorde"}, {"start": 3077, "end": 3091, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es"}]}, {"text": "CRICKET - ENGLISH COUNTY CHAMPIONSHIP SCORES.

Spot gold prices rose 0.2 % to $ 1,840.65 per ounce by 0725 GMT , while U.S. gold futures were up 0.2 % at $ 1,843.90 . \" Softer jobs growth and tighter social mobility restrictions ostensibly lower the hurdle for a policy response from ( U.S. ) Congress , \" said Stephen Innes , chief global market strategist at financial services firm Axi .

However , gold 's gains were capped as Britain prepared to become the first country to roll out the Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine this week .

Nadim Ladki AL-AIN, United Arab Emirates 1996-12-06 Japan began the defence of their Asian Cup title with a lucky 2-1 win against Syria in a Group C championship match on Friday. But China saw their luck desert them in the second match of the group, crashing to a surprise 2-0 defeat to newcomers Uzbekistan. China controlled most of the match and saw several chances missed until the 78th minute when Uzbek striker Igor Shkvyrin took advantage of a misdirected defensive header to lob the ball over the advancing Chinese keeper and into an empty net. Oleg Shatskiku made sure of the win in injury time, hitting an unstoppable left foot shot from just outside the area. The former Soviet republic was playing in an Asian Cup finals tie for the first time. Despite winning the Asian Games title two years ago, Uzbekistan are in the finals as outsiders. Two goals from defensive errors in the last six minutes allowed Japan to come from behind and collect all three points from their opening meeting against Syria. Takuya Takagi scored the winner in the 88th minute, rising to head a Hiroshige Yanagimoto cross towards the Syrian goal which goalkeeper Salem Bitar appeared to have covered but then allowed to slip into the net. It was the second costly blunder by Syria in four minutes. Defender Hassan Abbas rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of Bitar's goal. Nader Jokhadar had given Syria the lead with a well-struck header in the seventh minute. Japan then laid siege to the Syrian penalty area for most of the game but rarely breached the Syrian defence. Bitar pulled off fine saves whenever they did. Japan coach Shu Kamo said : ' ' The Syrian own goal proved lucky for us. The Syrians scored early and then played defensively and adopted long balls which made it hard for us. ' ' Japan, co-hosts of the World Cup in 2002 and ranked 20th in the world by FIFA, are favourites to regain their title here.

Cuttitta, who trainer George Coste said was certain to play on Saturday week, was named in a 21-man squad lacking only two of the team beaten 54-21 by England at Twickenham last month. Stefano Bordon is out through illness and Coste said he had dropped back row Corrado Covi, who had been recalled for the England game after five years out of the national team. Cuttitta announced his retirement after the 1995 World Cup, where he took issue with being dropped from the Italy side that faced England in the pool stages. Coste said he had approached the player two months ago about a comeback. \"He ended the World Cup on the wrong note,\" Coste said. \"I thought it would be useful to have him back and he said he would be available.

Duran, 45, takes on little-known Mexican Ariel Cruz, 30, in a super middleweight non-title bout in Panama City. The fight, Duran's first on home soil for 10 years, is being billed here as the \"Return of the Legend\" and Duran still talks as if he was in his prime. \"I want a fifth title. This match is to prepare me. I feel good. I'm not retiring,\" Duran told Reuters. But those close to the boxer acknowledge that the man who has won championships in four different weight classes-- lightweight, welterweight, junior middleweight and middleweight-- is drawing close to the end of his career. \"Each time he fights, he's on the last frontier of his career. If he loses Saturday, it could devalue his position as one of the world's great boxers,\" Panamanian Boxing Association President Ramon Manzanares said. Duran, whose 97-12 record spans three decades, hopes a win in the 10-round bout will earn him a rematch against Puerto Rico's Hector \"Macho\" Camacho.

AL-AIN, United Arab Emirates 1996-12-06 Two goals in the last six minutes gave holders Japan an uninspiring 2-1 Asian Cup victory over Syria on Friday. Takuya Takagi headed the winner in the 88th minute of the group C game after goalkeeper Salem Bitar spoiled a mistake-free display by allowing the ball to slip under his body. It was the second Syrian defensive blunder in four minutes. Defender Hassan Abbas rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of Bitar's goal. Syria had taken the lead from their first serious attack in the seventh minute. Nader Jokhadar headed a cross from the right by Ammar Awad into the top right corner of Kenichi Shimokawa's goal. Japan then laid siege to the Syrian penalty area and had a goal disallowed for offside in the 16th minute. A minute later, Bitar produced a good double save, first from Kazuyoshi Miura's header and then blocked a Takagi follow-up shot. Bitar saved well again from Miura in the 37th minute, parrying away his header from a corner. Japan started the second half brightly but Bitar denied them an equaliser when he dived to his right to save Naoki Soma's low drive in the 53rd minute.

The ministry said in a statement that the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech , whose final trial results showed it had a 95 % success rate and no serious side effects , will be delivered next year . Earlier on Monday , President Jair Bolsonaro said that the government will offer COVID-19 vaccines to all Brazilians free of charge , once health regulator Anvisa gives it scientific and legal approval .

He expects Anvisa to approve it , regardless of the political storm between Bolsonaro and Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria over competing vaccines . \u201c I want to think that no political problem is bigger than people \u2019s lives , \u201d Covas said in an interview with GloboNews .

Doria \u2019s ambitious timeline comes even though the Sinovac vaccine has yet to be approved by Anvisa .

Larry Fine NEW YORK 1996-08-30 Andre Agassi escaped disaster on Thursday but Wimbledon finalist MaliVai Washington and Marcelo Rios were not so fortunate on a night of upsets at the U.S. Open. The 11th-seeded Washington fell short of reprising his Wimbledon miracle comeback as he lost to red-hot wildcard Alex O'Brien 6-3 6-4 5-7 3-6 6-3 in a two hour 51 minute struggle on the Stadium court. Next door on the grandstand, 10th seed Rios lost to another player with a Wimbledon connection-- bad boy Jeff Tarango. The temperamental left-hander defeated the Chilean 6-4 4-6 7-6 6-2. The day programme went smoothly although sixth-seeded former champion Agassi had to wriggle out of a dangerous 3-6 0-4 hole, winning 18 of the last 19 games against India's Leander Paes. But the night belonged to the upstarts. Washington, who climbed back from a 1-5 deficit, two sets down in the third set against Todd Martin in the Wimbledon semifinals, looked poised for another sensational comeback. O'Brien, a winner two weeks ago in New Haven for his first pro title, served for the match at 5-4 in the third set before Washington came charging back. \"I just kept saying to myself, ' keep giving yourself the best chance to win, keep battling, maybe something will happen, '\" said the 26-year-old O'Brien, ranked 65th. \"I kept my composure and I was proud of myself for that-- usually I would have folded up the tent and gone home.\" The hard-serving O'Brien, a former U.S. collegiate national champion, fired up 17 aces to ultimately subdue the never-say-die Washington. The fifth set stayed on serve until the sixth game, when Washington, after saving one break point with a forehand winner down the line, netted a backhand to give O'Brien a 4-2 lead. The Texan blasted in two aces to hold serve at 5-2 and then converted his eighth match point for victory when Washington found the net with another backhand from 40-0. \"You just kind of keep fighting and you keep trying to make him play a little bit. I think he got a little tight at a couple of moments,\" said Washington. \"But I think he served pretty well when he had to.\" Tarango, whose Wimbledon tantrum two years ago brought him a $ 28,000 fine and suspension from this year's tournament at the All-England Club, argued calls and taunted fans in his lively two hour, 24 minute tango with Rios on the grandstand. A boisterous cheering section backed the distracted Chilean and booed the lanky American, who ate up all the attention. \"I'm an emotional player,\" said the 104th-ranked Tarango. \"I think I played very well tonight, very focused.\" The match turned on the third-set tiebreaker, which the American won 7-5 much to the dismay of the spectators. \"I love the crowd if they boo me every day. It fires me up, makes me play my best tennis,\" Tarango said. \"I played some of my best tennis in college when fraternities were throwing beer on me. If tennis was like that every day, I think everybody wold be having a lot more fun.\" Rios did not appreciate Tarango's antics. \"He's always complaining too much,\" said Rios. \"But I think it's not that. I think I played really bad. It was tough to play at night. Balls were going really fast. I lost too many points that I never lose.

Robert Kitson LONDON 1996-12-06 Centre Jason Little will miss Australia's end-of-tour fixture against the Barbarians at Twickenham on Saturday. Little has opted not to risk aggravating the knee injury which ruled him out of a large chunk of the tour and is replaced by fellow Queenslander Daniel Herbert. Owen Finegan has recovered from the knocks he took in last weekend's test against Wales and retains his place in the back-row ahead of Daniel Manu. The Wallabies have their sights set on a 13th successive victory to end their European tour with a 100 percent record but also want to turn on the style and provide David Campese with a fitting send-off in his final match in Australian colours. The Wallabies currently have no plans to make any special presentation to the 34-year-old winger but a full house of 75,000 spectators will still gather in the hope of witnessing one last moment of magic. Campese will be up against a familiar foe in the shape of Barbarians captain Rob Andrew, the man who kicked Australia to defeat with a last-ditch drop-goal in the World Cup quarter-final in Cape Town. \"Campo has a massive following in this country and has had the public with him ever since he first played here in 1984,\" said Andrew, also likely to be making his final Twickenham appearance. On tour, Australia have won all four tests against Italy, Scotland, Ireland and Wales, and scored 414 points at an average of almost 35 points a game. League duties restricted the Barbarians ' selectorial options but they still boast 13 internationals including England full-back Tim Stimpson and recalled wing Tony Underwood, plus All Black forwards Ian Jones and Norm Hewitt.

MILWAUKEE, Wisconsin 1996-08-29 Nolan Henke fired a nine-under-par 62 to grab a two-shot lead after the opening round of the $ 1.2 million Greater Milwaukee Open Thursday as 20-year-old Tiger Woods shot 67 in his professional debut. Henke stood two strokes ahead of Bob Estes and three up on Billy Andrade, Duffy Waldorf and Jesper Parnevik. Woods, who turned pro Tuesday after winning an unprecedented third successive U.S. Amateur Championship, almost eagled the 18th hole. He settled for a birdie and a four-under opening round that left him five shots off the pace. \"Yesterday was the toughest day I've had for a long time,\" Woods said. \"Today, I got to play golf.\" He added : \"I thought I got off off to a great start. It was a perfect start. I'm in a good position.\" Henke, who called his round a \"pleasant surprise,\" finished with six birdies on the final eight holes. \"We finally got things going in the right direction,\" he said. \"It was my best round in a very long time. My short game has improved since I've had to use it so often. That's always been the worst part of my game. All in all, playing bad's been a good experience.\" Henke, who came within one shot of the course record set by Andrew Magee during Wednesday's pro-am, has three career PGA Tour victories, but none since the 1993 BellSouth Classic. Estes, whose only win came at the 1994 Texas Open and whose best finish this year was a third-place tie at the Nortel Open in January, eagled the par-five fourth hole and added five birdies to grab sole possession of second place. \"No bogeys on the card,\" he noted. \"Sometimes I take more pride in that.\" Woods was among a group of 13 players at four under, including 1993 champion Billy Mayfair, who tied for second at last week's World Series of Golf, and former U.S. Open champ Payne Stewart. Defending champion Scott Hoch shot a three-under 68 and was six strokes back. Phil Mickelson, the only four-time winner on the PGA Tour, skipped the tournament after winning the World Series of Golf last week.

Watched by an array of former Olympic sprint champions at the Berlin grand prix meeting, Mitchell made a brilliant start in the 100 metres and held off Bailey's strong finish to win in 10.08 seconds despite cool conditions. Bailey, who set a world record of 9.84 on his way to victory in Atlanta, could not catch his American rival and had to settle for third in a tight finish. Jamaica's Michael Green was second with 10.09 with Bailey finishing in 10.13. Last Friday Mitchell, who finished fourth at the Atlanta Games, upstaged a trio of Olympic champions including Bailey to win the 100 in Brussels. Earlier this month he also beat world champion Bailey in Zurich. Berlin, Brussels and Zurich all belong to the most lucrative series in the sport, the Golden Four. Among the crowd on Friday were Olympic 100 metres champions going back to 1948. They had been invited to the meeting to watch a special relay to mark the 60th anniversary of Jesse Owens's four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics in the same Berlin stadium. \"Today the concentration was the most important thing for me,\" Mitchell said.

Robert Galvin MELBOURNE 1996-12-06 Australia gave Brian Lara another reason to be miserable when they beat West Indies by five wickets in the opening World Series limited overs match on Friday. Lara, disciplined for misconduct on Wednesday, was dismissed for five to extend a disappointing run of form on tour. Australia, who hold a 2-0 lead in the five-match test series, overhauled West Indies ' total of 172 all out with eight balls to spare to end a run of six successive one-day defeats. All-rounder Greg Blewett steered his side to a comfortable victory with an unbeaten 57 in 90 balls to the delight of the 42,442 crowd. Man-of-the match Blewett came to the wicket with the total on 70 for two and hit three fours during an untroubled innings lasting 129 minutes. His crucial fifth-wicket partnership with fellow all-rounder Stuart Law, who scored 21, added 71 off 85 balls. Lara looked out of touch during his brief stay at the crease before chipping a simple catch to Shane Warne at mid-wicket. West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd has apologised for Lara's behaviour on Tuesday. He (Lara) had told Australia coach Geoff Marsh that wicketkeeper Ian Healy was unwelcome in the visitors ' dressing room. The Melbourne crowd were clearly angered by the incident, loudly jeering the West Indies vice-captain as he walked to the middle. It was left to fellow left-hander Shivnarine Chanderpaul to hold the innings together with a gritty 54 despite the handicap of an injured groin. Chanderpaul was forced to rely on a runner for most of his innings after hurting himself as he scurried back to his crease to avoid being run out.

The benchmark 10-year yield was down 4.3 basis points at 0.9261 % in afternoon trading , flattening a key part of the yield curve . On Friday the yield on the note reached 0.986 % , its highest level since March and close to the 1 % threshold , on optimism that a poor jobs report would drive Washington to pass a new round of economic stimulus . Monday 's reversal showed the questions investors still face during a period when vaccines seem ready to end the pandemic but on an uncertain timeline while health statistics deteriorate , said Jason Pride , chief investment officer for private wealth at Glenmede . \" This market is seeing volatility as people wrestle with this concept of having a vaccine and too-early reopenings \" at the same time , he said . While the tech-heavy Nasdaq surged to an all-time high on Monday , the blue-chip Dow and the broad S&P 500 were both lower in afternoon trading . Kim Rupert , senior economist for Action Economics , said the higher demand for Treasuries on Monday seemed to reflect a buying opportunity for some investors and called the trading pattern \" a corrective move . \" President-elect Joe Biden said he will nominate California Attorney General Xavier Becerra for secretary of health and human services on Monday as one of the top officials on his team to fight the pandemic . The U.S. daily death toll has exceeded 2,000 in recent days as officials prepare for a mammoth vaccination effort . Authorities in California on Monday compelled much of the most populous state to close shop and stay at home the day after it reported a record 30,000-plus new coronavirus cases . A closely watched part of the U.S. Treasury yield curve measuring the gap between yields on two- and 10-year Treasury notes , seen as an indicator of economic expectations , was at 78 basis points , about 4 basis points lower than Friday 's close . At one point on Friday it reached 82.5 basis points , its highest since February 2018 . The two-year U.S. Treasury yield , which typically moves in step with interest rate expectations , was down almost a basis point at 0.1448 % in afternoon trading .

MELBOURNE 1996-12-06 West Indies batsman Brian Lara suffered another blow to his Australian tour, after already being disciplined for misconduct, when he was dismissed cheaply in the first limited overs match against Australia on Friday. Lara, who earned a stern rebuke from his own tour management after an angry outburst against Australia wicketkeeper Ian Healy, scored five to prolong a run of poor form with the bat. The West Indies vice-captain struggled for timing during his 36-minute stay at the crease before chipping a ball from medium pacer Tom Moody straight to Shane Warne at mid-wicket. West Indies were 53 for two in 15 overs when rain stopped play at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after captain Courtney Walsh won the toss and elected to bat. Lara's outburst three days ago has clearly turned some of the Australian public against him. As he walked to the wicket he was greeted by loud jeers from sections of the crowd. On several occasions during his innings, the crowd joined together in a series of obscene chants against him. Tour manager Clive Lloyd on Wednesday apologised for Lara's behaviour in confronting Australia coach Geoff Marsh in the opposition dressing room to protest against his dismissal in the second test on Tuesday. Lloyd did not say what form the discipline would take. Lara, who holds the record for the highest score in test and first-class cricket, was unhappy about Healy's role in the incident and questioned whether the ball had carried to the Australia keeper. Australia went on to win the match at the Sydney Cricket Ground by 124 runs to take a two-nil lead in the five-test series after Lara failed in both innings.

California Governor Gavin Newsom \u2019s order came into effect one day after the state set a record with more than 30,000 new COVID-19 cases , triggered in areas of Southern California where fewer than 15 % of intensive care hospital beds remain available . In addition , five counties in Northern California surrounding the San Francisco Bay Area have voluntarily imposed the restrictions even before reaching the intensive care unit threshold . Combined , the areas cover about three-quarters of the state \u2019s nearly 40 million people . Dr. Celine Gounder , a member of President-elect Joe Biden \u2019s coronavirus advisory board , said California had little choice . \u201c Given how out of control the virus is at this point , we are having to dial up some of those restrictions again , \u201d Gounder told CBS News . \u201c Ideally , we should be more proactive than this . \u201d In reporting more than 30,000 new cases on Sunday , the state exceeded its previous high of 21,986 set on Dec. 4 , and notched a record high for hospitalized COVID-19 patients as well . Nationwide , COVID-19 infections in United States are at their peak with an average of 193,863 new cases reported each day over the past week , according to a Reuters tally of official data .

REUTERS / Stephen Lam There have been 14.7 million confirmed infections and 282,253 coronavirus-related deaths reported in the country since the pandemic began , the most in the world . California has been under a stay-at-home order for all but essential services since March . The new order , which will last at least three weeks , bans private gatherings of any size , shuts all but critical infrastructure and retail operations , and requires everyone to wear a mask and maintain physical distancing . But the sheriffs of Los Angeles , Orange and Riverside counties have said they will refuse to enforce the order . Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco said in a videotaped message that his office \u201c will not be blackmailed \u201d into enforcing the governor \u2019s orders , and Orange County Sheriff Don Barnes said in a statement his deputies would not respond to calls to enforce violations of the mask mandate , stay-at-home orders or the ban on social gatherings . FAUCI SEES \u2018 BAD TIME \u2019 AHEAD To avoid a critical shortage of hospital beds , New York state health officials will order hospitals to increase their capacity by 25 % and ask retired doctors and nurses to come back to work , Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Monday . If the hospitalization rate fails to stabilize over the next five days , indoor dining in New York City will be halted , Cuomo said . Dr. Anthony Fauci , tapped by Biden to be his chief medical adviser on the coronavirus , warned the nationwide surge could get worse after the year-end holiday season . After millions ignored expert advice and traveled for the Thanksgiving holiday in November , Fauci anticipated Americans would once again behave recklessly during Christmas and New Year \u2019s Eve festivities . Spikes in the death toll typically appear about three weeks after surges in infections and hospitalizations . \u201c Mid-January is probably going to be a bad time , \u201d said Fauci , appearing with Cuomo in his video news conference . Biden , a Democrat , has said he will make the pandemic his top priority upon taking over for departing President Donald Trump , a Republican , on Jan. 20 .

FILE PHOTO : Former GlaxoSmithKline pharmaceutical executive Moncef Slaoui , who will serve as chief adviser on the effort to find a vaccine for the coronavirus disease ( COVID-19 ) pandemic , waits to speak as President Donald Trump holds a coronavirus disease response event in the Rose Garden at the White House in Washington , U.S. , May 15 , 2020 . REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque / File Photo Moncef Slaoui , chief adviser to the U.S. government \u2019s Operation Warp Speed initiative , said he has not yet met with Biden , who last week criticized the Trump administration \u2019s vaccine distribution plan . \u201c We really look forward to it because actually things have been really very appropriately planned , \u201d Slaoui said in an interview with CBS \u2019 \u201c Face the Nation . \u201d Biden said on Friday his team had not seen a detailed outline from the Trump administration to distribute a vaccine to various states , which he called an expensive and difficult process . \u201c There is no detailed plan that we \u2019 ve seen , anyway , as to how you get the vaccine out of a container , into an injection syringe , into somebody \u2019s arm , \u201d Biden said . Slaoui said part of the confusion may be that the government \u2019s plan relies on state health agencies to deliver the vaccine . \u201c I think the plans are there and I feel confident that once we will explain it , everything in detail . I hope the new transition team will understand that things are well planned , \u201d he told the CBS program . The United States is struggling with a resurgence of the virus , with record infections and a daily death toll that has exceeded 2,000 in recent days . More than 281,000 Americans have died from the COVID-19 disease , according to a Reuters tally . President Donald Trump \u2019s refusal to acknowledge his loss to Biden in the Nov. 3 presidential election caused a delay in the transition process that allowed White House health advisers to communicate with the new Biden health advisory team . Biden was due to announce members of his public health team this week . VACCINE NOT ENOUGH First-responders , health care workers and nursing home residents will be the first groups to receive the vaccine once the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approves it , which is expected in the next week or two . The FDA \u2019s outside advisers are scheduled to meet on Thursday to review Pfizer \u2019s emergency use application for its vaccine Slaoui has said the second tranche of people to get the vaccine will likely include essential employees such as postal workers , and then the general population will follow . Asked on Sunday when Americans would start seeing the impact of the vaccine , Slaoui told CBS that might happen for the most susceptible people in January or February . \u201c But on a population basis , for our life to start getting back to normal , we \u2019re talking about April or May , \u201d he said . With the winter holiday season approaching , U.S. health experts have been pleading with Americans to not let up on their coronavirus safety protocols - wearing masks , social distancing and avoiding large gatherings . \u201c That \u2019s what \u2019s gonna get us most through this , \u201d U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar said on ABC \u2019s \u201c This Week \u201d program . Dr. Deborah Birx , who serves with Azar on the White House coronavirus task force , told NBC \u2019s \u201c Meet the Press \u201d that public health officials have had to battle incorrect messages from the Trump administration about masks and other mitigation measures . \u201c I want to be very frank to the American people .

Brigham Young was stopped on the 1-yard line on the game \u2019s last play . The outcome gave the Chanticleers ( 10-0 ) their most significant victory in program history . This was a hastily arranged clash between two teams seeking to gain more respect in the polls and begging for national attention with the season winding down . Coastal Carolina quarterback Grayson McCall was 10-for-15 for 85 yards passing . He also picked up 68 rushing yards . Marable scored the go-ahead touchdown on a 2-yard run with 11:35 remaining before a two-point conversion play failed . After Brigham Young ( 9-1 ) punted from near midfield , the Chanticleers churned out two first downs as the Cougars used their final timeout . Brigham Young took over after a punt at its own 18-yard line with 55 seconds left . The Cougars reached the Coastal Carolina 18 before Zach Wilson \u2019s pass to Dax Milne , who was halted short of the goal line as time expired . Wilson was 19-for-30 for 240 yards with one touchdown and an interception . Coastal Carolina has a game next week at Troy and then the Sun Belt Conference championship game at home against Louisiana the following week . Brigham Young , which had been idle for nearly a month other than a Nov. 21 game , entered the game averaging more than 47 points per game . The Cougars wrap up the regular season next Saturday at home against San Diego State . Coastal Carolina opened the scoring with 10 seconds left in the first quarter on Marable \u2019s 6-yard run , though an extra-point kick failed . Less than 90 seconds later , Tyler Allgeier ran 42 yards to put Brigham Young on the board . The Chanticleers were back on top on Reese White \u2019s 1-yard run before Wilson connected with Milne on a 41-yard pass play to help the Cougars claim a 14-13 halftime edge . Brigham Young extended its lead to 17-13 on Jake Oldroyd \u2019s 29-yard field goal to conclude the opening possession of the second half . Massimo Biscardi countered with a 41-yarder for Coastal Carolina . This game came about with not much more than 48 hours notice , with Brigham Young pretty much on standby . When Coastal Carolina \u2019s home game with Liberty was nixed because of coronavirus issues involving the Liberty program , Brigham Young filled in despite needing to make a cross-country trip . -- Field Level Media", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 10, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._J._Marable"}, {"start": 62, "end": 78, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_Carolina_Chanticleers_football"}, {"start": 99, "end": 112, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYU_Cougars_football"}, {"start": 178, "end": 190, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway,_South_Carolina"}, {"start": 193, "end": 206, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYU_Cougars_football"}, {"start": 520, "end": 536, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_Carolina_Chanticleers_football"}, {"start": 549, "end": 556, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayson_McCall"}, {"start": 638, "end": 645, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._J._Marable"}, {"start": 763, "end": 776, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYU_Cougars_football"}, {"start": 900, "end": 913, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYU_Cougars_football"}, {"start": 1008, "end": 1024, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_Carolina_Chanticleers_football"}, {"start": 1035, "end": 1046, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Wilson"}, {"start": 1058, "end": 1067, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dax_Milne"}, {"start": 1202, "end": 1218, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_Carolina_Chanticleers_football"}, {"start": 1243, "end": 1247, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Trojans_football"}, {"start": 1261, "end": 1280, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Belt_Conference"}, {"start": 1315, "end": 1324, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Ragin%27_Cajuns_football"}, {"start": 1346, "end": 1359, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYU_Cougars_football"}, {"start": 1556, "end": 1571, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_State_Aztecs_football"}, {"start": 1574, "end": 1590, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_Carolina_Chanticleers_football"}, {"start": 1779, "end": 1792, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYU_Cougars_football"}, {"start": 1900, "end": 1905, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milne"}, {"start": 1979, "end": 1992, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYU_Cougars_football"}, {"start": 2162, "end": 2178, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_Carolina_Chanticleers_football"}, {"start": 2249, "end": 2262, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_Young"}, {"start": 2293, "end": 2309, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_Carolina_Chanticleers_football"}, {"start": 2328, "end": 2335, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Flames_football"}, {"start": 2390, "end": 2397, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Flames_football"}, {"start": 2408, "end": 2421, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_Young"}]}, {"text": "NHL ICE HOCKEY - STANDINGS AFTER THURSDAY'S GAMES.

BUCHAREST 1996-08-30 Romanian listed state engineer Comelf said it almost doubled six-month output, with net profit rising by 33 percent to 1.069 billion lei. But the company complained inflation and the artificially high rate of the leu cut profit margins on exports, keeping profits well below its forecast of 1.4 billion lei. Comelf's six-month output rose to 4,378 tonnes of equipment from 2,684 tonnes in the equivalent period in 1995, the company report to the Bucharest stock exchange showed. Comelf, based in the central Transylvanian town of Bistrita, manufactures water purification equipment, machinery for the thermal power sector and other equipment. \"In the first six months of 1996 we concentrated on increasing the volume of our output and exports in particular and improving the quality of our products,\" the report said. From January to June Comelf exported 59 percent of its output, up from 37.3 percent in the same period last year. The company said higher than anticipated inflation and rising raw materials and wage costs also hit profits. Year-on-year inflation, initially estimated at 20 percent in December, was 33.8 percent in June, higher than a revised end-year forecast of 30 percent. The 12 month figure quickened to 40.3 percent in July. The leu currency has slipped only gradually this year, and is currently quoted at an official rate of 3,162 to the dollar, well below the 3,550 retail price that exporters say is more realistic.-- Luli Popescu, Bucharest Newsroom 40-1 3120264", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 7, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania"}, {"start": 44, "end": 53, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest"}, {"start": 65, "end": 73, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania"}, {"start": 511, "end": 520, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucharest"}, {"start": 573, "end": 586, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transylvania"}, {"start": 595, "end": 603, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bistri\u0163a"}]}, {"text": "NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Oil prices slipped on Monday as the positive impact from COVID-19 vaccine news and an OPEC+ deal on oil production cuts was undermined by surging coronavirus cases and heightened tensions between the United States and China .

INDIANAPOLIS 1996-12-06 The injury-plagued Indianapolis Colts lost another quarterback on Thursday but last year's AFC finalists rallied together to shoot down the Philadelphia Eagles 37-10 in a showdown of playoff contenders. Marshall Faulk rushed for 101 yards and two touchdowns and Jason Belser returned an interception 44 yards for a score as the Colts improved to 8-6, the same mark as the Eagles, who lost for the fourth time in five games. Paul Justin, starting for the sidelined Jim Harbaugh, was 14-of-23 for 144 yards and a touchdown for the the Colts, who played their last home game of the season. Indianapolis closes with games at Kansas City and Cincinnati. The Eagles were held without a touchdown until the final five seconds. Philadelphia, which fell from an NFC East tie with the Dallas Cowboys and Washington Redskins, go on the road against the New York Jets and then entertain Arizona. The loss by Philadelphia allowed the idle Green Bay Packers (10-3) to clinch the first NFC playoff berth. The Colts won despite the absence of injured starting defensive tackle Tony Siragusa, cornerback Ray Buchanan and linebacker Quentin Coryatt. Faulk carried 16 times, including a 13-yard TD run in the first quarter and a seven-yard score early in the final period. Justin made his second straight start for Harbaugh, who has a knee injury. Justin suffered a sprained right shoulder in the third quarter and did not return. Third-stringer Kerwin Bell, a 1988 draft choice of the Miami Dolphins, made his NFL debut and was 5-of-5 for 75 yards, including a 20-yard scoring strike to Marvin Harrison in the third period. A 39-yard interference penalty against Philadelphia's Troy Vincent set up Faulk's first score around left end that capped an 80-yard march 5:17 into the game and the rout was on. Eagles quarterback Ty Detmer was 17-of-34 for 182 yards before he was benched. Ricky Watters, who leads the NFC in rushing, left the game after getting kneed to the helmet after gaining 33 yards on seven carries.", "value": [{"start": 36, "end": 42, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles"}, {"start": 68, "end": 80, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis"}, {"start": 111, "end": 129, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts"}, {"start": 183, "end": 186, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference"}, {"start": 232, "end": 251, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles"}, {"start": 295, "end": 309, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Faulk"}, {"start": 354, "end": 366, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Belser"}, {"start": 420, "end": 425, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts"}, {"start": 464, "end": 470, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles"}, {"start": 516, "end": 527, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Justin"}, {"start": 556, "end": 568, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Harbaugh"}, {"start": 625, "end": 630, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts"}, {"start": 679, "end": 691, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts"}, {"start": 713, "end": 724, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs"}, {"start": 729, "end": 739, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds"}, {"start": 745, "end": 751, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles"}, {"start": 812, "end": 824, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles"}, {"start": 845, "end": 853, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_East"}, {"start": 867, "end": 881, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys"}, {"start": 886, "end": 905, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Redskins"}, {"start": 934, "end": 947, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets"}, {"start": 967, "end": 974, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals"}, {"start": 988, "end": 1000, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles"}, {"start": 1018, "end": 1035, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers"}, {"start": 1063, "end": 1066, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_Conference"}, {"start": 1086, "end": 1091, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Colts"}, {"start": 1153, "end": 1166, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Siragusa"}, {"start": 1179, "end": 1191, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Buchanan"}, {"start": 1207, "end": 1222, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Coryatt"}, {"start": 1519, "end": 1530, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerwin_Bell"}, {"start": 1534, "end": 1538, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_NFL_Draft"}, {"start": 1559, "end": 1573, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins"}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1676, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Harrison"}, {"start": 1737, "end": 1749, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles"}, {"start": 1752, "end": 1764, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Vincent"}, {"start": 1877, "end": 1883, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles"}, {"start": 1896, "end": 1905, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ty_Detmer"}, {"start": 1956, "end": 1969, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Watters"}]}, {"text": "Canada government cash balances fall in week.

The coronavirus crisis compounded difficulties for the company , which has been hit by profit warnings , management changes and an accounting scandal since founder Ray Kelvin stepped down as CEO in 2019 after misconduct allegations , which he denies .

CHICAGO 1996-08-30 U.S. debt futures finished a shortened pre-holiday session sharply lower, as the markets were shaken by a stronger than expected rise in the August National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) index for the Chicago area, traders and analysts said. The August Chicago NAPM rose 8.8 points to 60.0, its highest level since 62.6 in February 1995 and the largest monthly rise since December 1993. Primary dealers immediately sold Eurodollar and bond futures, after the market on average was expecting the index to rise marginally to 51.9 from July's 51.2. Traders also said Japanese investors were unwinding long Eurodollar futures / short swaps, and that heavy put buying helped pressure Eurodollars to lower levels before the close. One U.S. firm bought 35,000 September 97 mid-curve put options at a strike price of 93.25 to 93.30 in the last two sessions, while a French firm bought 4,000 September 93.30 to 93.32 put spreads. \"Even before the data came out, we were seeing put buying,\" one floor trader said. Meanwhile, funds were reportedly good sellers of five-year notes. Rumors circulated that the Federal Reserve was buying five-year notes, and that a renowned hedge fund manager was buying 10-year notes in the cash markets. However, December T-bonds ended below a major trendline level at 106-26/32, as the yield in the cash bond market set its highest monthly close since April 1995 at 7.12 percent, one analyst said. December bonds blew through the July 30 low of 107-06/32, even though conditions were slightly oversold, traders said. The December calendar spread continued to widen, also reflecting the market's fear of rising inflation. While the market continues to price-in higher U.S. interest rates, there was little conviction to the theory that the Federal Reserve would tighten rates before the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on September 24. Federal Reserve governor Lawrence Lindsey, speaking on U.S. cable television network CNBC, said the U.S. economy appears on balance to be a bit strong, adding the central bank would not curb growth provided inflation remains in check. Earlier in the day, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan said at the annual Jackson Hole symposium that the goal of price stability is within reach for major nations. Traders said the Fed's decision to adopt a tightening bias at the July FOMC meeting has cast more focus on every piece of U.S. economic news. \"The Fed's stance has really sensitized us to all this data,\" one analyst said. \"The revisions to GDP, for example, may not have attracted a lot of attention.\" At the end of pit trade, December bonds were off 27/32 at 106-25/32, 10-year notes down 21/32 at 105-17/32, munibonds off 17/32 at 111-20/32, December Eurodollars were down 11 bps at 93.94, March Eurodollars were off 13 bps at 93.72 and March T-bills were down 12 bps at 94.33.", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 4, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 39, "end": 46, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"}, {"start": 53, "end": 60, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"}, {"start": 72, "end": 76, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 287, "end": 294, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"}, {"start": 339, "end": 346, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"}, {"start": 506, "end": 516, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurodollar"}, {"start": 650, "end": 658, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"}, {"start": 815, "end": 819, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 944, "end": 950, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"start": 1183, "end": 1198, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve"}, {"start": 1776, "end": 1780, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1848, "end": 1863, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve"}, {"start": 1900, "end": 1929, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee"}, {"start": 1955, "end": 1970, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve"}, {"start": 1980, "end": 1996, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_B._Lindsey"}, {"start": 2010, "end": 2014, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 2040, "end": 2044, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC"}, {"start": 2055, "end": 2059, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 2210, "end": 2213, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve"}, {"start": 2223, "end": 2237, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Greenspan"}, {"start": 2257, "end": 2269, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Hole"}, {"start": 2365, "end": 2368, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve"}, {"start": 2470, "end": 2474, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 2495, "end": 2498, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve"}]}, {"text": "SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - Australia \u2019s second-largest city welcomed its first international passenger flight in five months on Monday , an arrival that will test the state of Victoria \u2019s revamped hotel quarantine system .

Pace, a junior, helped Ohio State to a 10-1 record and a berth in the Rose Bowl against Arizona State.

FARMINGTON HILLS, Mich. 1996-08-30 Shares of Douglas & Lomason Co were up 4-1/2 at 30-5/8 Friday afternoon after Thursday's announcement that the vehicle seat maker had agreed to be acquired by Magna International Inc for $ 31 a share, or $ 135 million. Magna was up 1/8 to 48-1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. Douglas & Lomason has 4.45 million common shares outstanding, some of which are option shares to be purchased at exercise prices less than the $ 31 offered price. The acquisition will beef up Markham, Ontario-based Magna's North American car and truck seating business, allowing it to better compete with Johnson Controls Inc and Lear Corp. Family-controlled Douglas & Lomason, which had 1995 revenue of $ 561 million, was finding it more difficult to compete for new seating contracts from vehicle makers, said James Hoey, chief financial officer. \"Unfortunately, in the auto industry these days, a $ 500 million company is not a big company anymore,\" Hoey said. \"This merger makes us much more competitive.\" He added that Douglas & Lomason's top executives have been asked to stay on with Magna after the merger, though their future roles have not yet been defined. Douglas & Lomason's profits were hurt in the past year by model changeovers, which had reduced production at some important customers, but are now recovering, analysts said. The company earned $ 11.2 million on sales of $ 299 million in the first six months of 1996, up from year-earlier earnings of $ 4.7 million on sales of $ 285.7 million. Ford plans to cut its roster of 2,300 tier-one suppliers-- those it deals with directly-- in half over the next five years. \"The deal really levels the seating field somewhat,\" said John Casesa of Schroder Wertheim & Co. \"It should give Magna the critical mass to be a bigger player in that market.\" Magna's traditional strength has been instrument panels, door panels and other interior components. Magna, Johnson Controls and Lear have been working to build up their capabilties to supply complete interiors to automakers, including seats, instrument panels, door panels carpeting and headliners.", "value": [{"start": 41, "end": 57, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmington_Hills,_Michigan"}, {"start": 59, "end": 63, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan"}, {"start": 235, "end": 258, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_International"}, {"start": 295, "end": 300, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_International"}, {"start": 329, "end": 352, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange"}, {"start": 546, "end": 553, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markham,_Ontario"}, {"start": 569, "end": 574, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magna_International"}, {"start": 577, "end": 591, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America"}, {"start": 659, "end": 679, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_Controls"}, {"start": 684, "end": 693, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lear_Corporation"}, {"start": 1565, "end": 1569, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company"}, {"start": 1972, "end": 1988, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_Controls"}, {"start": 1993, "end": 1997, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lear_Corporation"}]}, {"text": "LONDON / BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - Post-Brexit trade talks hung in the balance on Monday as Britain and the European Union made a last-ditch attempt to bridge significant differences and reach a deal that would avoid a disorderly exit in just 24 days .

In London , a British lawmaker in Johnson \u2019s ruling Conservative Party said France would have to make concessions on fishing and the EU would have to drop their demands on the level playing field .

LONDON 1996-08-30 Seven Iraqis who seized a Sudanese airliner with 199 people aboard and forced it to fly to London were on Friday charged with hijack, ending speculation that they might be offered immediate asylum in Britain. Police said the seven men, who freed all their hostages after the plane landed at Stansted airport on Tuesday and then appealed for asylum, would appear in court on Saturday. The Iraqis claimed they were \"ordinary people persecuted by the regime of Saddam (Hussein)\" but interior ministry officials had consistently said it was likely the seven would be charged with hijack before any plea for asylum was considered. Under English law the maximum sentence for hijack is life imprisonment, but there has been widespread speculation that the seven will receive lesser sentences and then be allowed to stay rather than being sent back to Iraq. The hijack began on Monday when an Amman-bound plane was taken over shortly after it took off from Khartoum.

GERMANY - Bunds extended losses, flirting with session lows after falling victim to sharply higher U.S. economic data which revived fears that interest rates may soon turn higher. The September Bund future on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) was trading at 97.18, down 0.20 from Thursday's settlement price. BRITAIN - Gilts struggled off the day's lows but ended 10/32 down on the day. A sharp plunge in U.S. Treasuries after a shock rise in the Chicago PMI pulled gilts lower, but traders said the market was nervous anyway ahead of August MO data and the PMI survey due on Monday. The September long gilt future on LIFFE was trading at 107-2/32, down 8/32 from Thursday's settlement price. FRANCE - Bond and PIBOR futures ended the day higher despite much stronger than expected U.S. data. The September notional bond future on the MATIF in Paris settled at 123.14, up 0.04 from Thursday's settlement price. ITALY - Bond futures held to easier levels in late afternoon after the sharp drop in Treasuries, but a resilient lira helped limit BTP losses. The September bond future on LIFFE was trading at 115.45, down 0.13 from Thursday's settlement price. UNITED STATES - Prices of U.S. Treasury securities were trading sharply lower near midday after a surprisingly strong Chicago Purchasing Managers ' report shook the markets ahead of the long Labour Day weekend. The September Treasury bond future on the Chicago Board of Trade was trading at 107-11/32, down 26/32 from Thursday's settlement price. The long bond was quoted to yield 7.12 percent. JAPAN - Yield for benchmark 182nd cash bond fell on buy-backs following weaker-than-expected industrial output data, which convinced traders the BOJ would not raise interest rates soon. Japanese Goverment Bonds futures which closed before the output data, lost much of day's gains as Tokyo stock prices recovered from the day's low.In after hours trading the September future on LIFFE was trading at 122.53, up 0.26 from Thursday's settlement price on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. EUROBONDS - Primary market activity was sharply lower, as players wound down ahead of Monday's U.S. Labour Day holiday and next week's U.S. employment data. NSW Treasury launched a A$ 100 million three-year discount bond aimed at Japanese investors. DNIB issued a 275 million Norwegian crown bond, which was pre-placed with a European institution.

Professor David McLeod, who examined Bruno, told the Sun :\" There is a risk he could be blinded in the eye if he steps into the ring again. He is in danger of getting a retinal detachment and there is no point in exposing himself to that. \"Bruno lost three world title fights before finally landing the crown by beating American Oliver McCall in a unanimous points decision at Wembley in September 1995.

World Athletics CEO Jon Ridgeon welcomed the amendment , insisting it would not affect the competition \u2019s integrity . \u201c The use of competition to complete the final testing of development shoes by manufacturers has always been an important part of the shoe development process , \u201d Ridgeon said . \u201c With shoe manufacturers agreeing to our new process of submitting specifications and shoes , if required , for approval ahead of being worn in competition , we are confident that this amendment will not impact the integrity of competition . \u201d Prototypes can be worn for a period of 12 months , after which they no longer qualify as development shoes and can no longer be used in competitions .", "value": [{"start": 2, "end": 9, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 124, "end": 139, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics"}, {"start": 341, "end": 356, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics"}, {"start": 476, "end": 491, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics"}, {"start": 621, "end": 643, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series"}, {"start": 654, "end": 662, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_sports"}, {"start": 749, "end": 753, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc."}, {"start": 839, "end": 853, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliud_Kipchoge"}, {"start": 882, "end": 888, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna"}, {"start": 893, "end": 906, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigid_Kosgei"}, {"start": 937, "end": 953, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Marathon"}, {"start": 962, "end": 966, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc."}, {"start": 1092, "end": 1107, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics"}, {"start": 1185, "end": 1189, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc."}, {"start": 1420, "end": 1435, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Athletics"}]}, {"text": "SOCCER - FRENCH LEAGUE RESULTS.

MOSCOW 1996-08-30 Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Friday that President Boris Yeltsin, who is vacationing outside Moscow, had backed security chief Alexander Lebed's peace plan for Chechnya, Interfax news agency said. \"Lebed is now in Chechnya solving some problems,\" Interfax quoted Chernomyrdin as saying. \"The main thing is his programme. It was agreed with Boris Nikolayevich (Yeltsin) yesterday.\" Lebed, whom Yeltsin ordered to restore peace in Chechnya, struck a military deal with separatist rebels last week ending the worst fighting in the region in more than a year. He later discussed with rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov a framework political agreement to tackle the most painful issue of the 20-month war-- the future political status of Chechnya. Lebed said on Friday he hoped to sign a document with the rebels later in the day which would deal with the political settlement of the conflict. Moscow, which wants to keep Chechnya as a part of the Russian Federation, sent troops to the region in December 1994 to quell its independence bid. Yeltsin has said any deal should preserve Russia's territorial integrity. Itar-Tass news agency quoted Lebed as saying that he would suggest to the rebels that the decision on Chechnya's future political status be deferred by up to 10 years. Lebed said he had a telephone conversation with Yeltsin late on Thursday but gave no details. Yeltsin's press office could not confirm the call. Chernomyrdin said on Thursday after a meeting with Lebed and top officials, who discussed Lebed's plans to restore peace in Chechnya, that it needed more work.", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 7, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin"}, {"start": 17, "end": 22, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lebed"}, {"start": 23, "end": 31, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya"}, {"start": 53, "end": 59, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow"}, {"start": 71, "end": 78, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}, {"start": 94, "end": 113, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Chernomyrdin"}, {"start": 144, "end": 157, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin"}, {"start": 186, "end": 192, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow"}, {"start": 220, "end": 235, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lebed"}, {"start": 253, "end": 261, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya"}, {"start": 263, "end": 271, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interfax"}, {"start": 291, "end": 296, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lebed"}, {"start": 307, "end": 315, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya"}, {"start": 340, "end": 348, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interfax"}, {"start": 356, "end": 368, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Chernomyrdin"}, {"start": 453, "end": 460, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin"}, {"start": 474, "end": 479, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lebed"}, {"start": 486, "end": 493, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin"}, {"start": 522, "end": 530, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya"}, {"start": 694, "end": 709, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aslan_Maskhadov"}, {"start": 828, "end": 836, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya"}, {"start": 838, "end": 843, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lebed"}, {"start": 984, "end": 990, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow"}, {"start": 1012, "end": 1020, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya"}, {"start": 1038, "end": 1056, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}, {"start": 1132, "end": 1139, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin"}, {"start": 1174, "end": 1180, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}, {"start": 1206, "end": 1215, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Telegraph_Agency_of_Russia"}, {"start": 1235, "end": 1240, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lebed"}, {"start": 1308, "end": 1316, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya"}, {"start": 1374, "end": 1379, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lebed"}, {"start": 1422, "end": 1429, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin"}, {"start": 1468, "end": 1475, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Yeltsin"}, {"start": 1519, "end": 1531, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Chernomyrdin"}, {"start": 1570, "end": 1575, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lebed"}, {"start": 1609, "end": 1614, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lebed"}, {"start": 1643, "end": 1651, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya"}]}, {"text": "Dec 7 ( Reuters ) - Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc said on Monday it has dosed the first participant in a mid-stage clinical trial testing its COVID-19 vaccine candidate , INO-4800 .

SARAJEVO 1996-08-30 Bosnia's ruling Moslem nationalist party on Friday called on its refugee voters to end a boycott of absentee balloting in national elections, citing assurances provided by a U.S. envoy, government radio said. The Bosnian government radio broadcast said U.S. Assistant Secretary of State John Kornblum had reassured SDA officials, including presumably its leader, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, whom he met during a Friday visit. But the radio report did not specify what guarantees, if any, the U.S. envoy had provided. Absentee voting in the elections began on Wednesday, August 28 and runs for a week. Election day for those living inside Bosnia is September 14. The Party of Democratic Action (SDA) had called on Wednesday for its followers abroad to boycott the absentee balloting because of voter registration irregularities, especially among Serb refugees. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) postponed municipal elections as a result of the irregularities but decided to proceed with voting for higher offices. The SDA, joined by two other parties, has been demanding that OSCE prohibit refugees voting from any place other than their pre-war place of residence as a means to prevent the elections from ratifying the results of ethnic cleansing.", "value": [{"start": 7, "end": 13, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"start": 39, "end": 47, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarajevo"}, {"start": 59, "end": 65, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnia"}, {"start": 75, "end": 81, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"start": 233, "end": 237, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 272, "end": 279, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnia"}, {"start": 312, "end": 316, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 346, "end": 359, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Kornblum"}, {"start": 374, "end": 377, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_of_Democratic_Action"}, {"start": 422, "end": 429, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnia"}, {"start": 440, "end": 457, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alija_Izetbegovi\u0107"}, {"start": 560, "end": 564, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 706, "end": 712, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosnia"}, {"start": 734, "end": 760, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_of_Democratic_Action"}, {"start": 762, "end": 765, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_of_Democratic_Action"}, {"start": 913, "end": 917, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia"}, {"start": 1114, "end": 1117, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_of_Democratic_Action"}]}, {"text": "VALDOSTA , Georgia ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Donald Trump campaigned in Georgia on Saturday for two Republican senators at a rally that some in his party feared could end up hurting , not helping , their chances by focusing on his efforts to reverse his own election defeat . U.S. President Donald Trump and Republican U.S. senator Kelly Loeffler listen as U.S. senator David Perdue speaks during a campaign rally , in Valdosta , Georgia , U.S. , December 5 , 2020 . REUTERS / Jonathan Ernst In his first rally appearance since he lost to Democrat Joe Biden in the Nov. 3 presidential contest , the Republican Trump reminded the chanting crowd that he came to southern Georgia to persuade them to vote Republican in runoffs on Jan. 5 . But he quickly turned to his repeated claims , made without evidence , of widespread fraud in the presidential election . \u201c They cheated and rigged our presidential election but we \u2019ll still win it . And they are going to try to rig this election too , \u201d Trump told the crowd in Valdosta , who chanted \u201c We love you ! \u201d and \u201c Four More Years ! \u201d He repeated his attacks on Republicans who have refused to back him , including Georgia \u2019s governor , Brian Kemp . Earlier on Saturday , Trump phoned Kemp and pressured the governor on Twitter to take further steps to help him overturn the election results . The outgoing president \u2019s claims of widespread voter fraud have been rejected by state and federal officials across the country , and his campaign \u2019s numerous legal challenges have almost all failed . Biden was the first Democratic presidential candidate to win in Georgia since 1992 . Statewide recounts , including a painstaking review by hand of some 5 million ballots , turned up no significant irregularities . The January runoffs pit two Republican senators , David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler , against well-funded Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock , seeking to capture a state that has not elected a Democratic senator in 20 years . The races will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate . Democrats , who already have the majority in the House of Representatives , need to win both seats to control the Senate . If Republicans win one seat , they will retain their majority and be able to block much of Biden \u2019s legislative agenda . Biden said he would visit Georgia to campaign for the Democratic candidates but did not give a timetable for his trip . ATTACKING REPUBLICANS Governor Kemp did not attend the rally due to the death in a car crash of Harrison Deal , a close family friend of the governor and staffer for Loeffler . He had an active exchange with Trump on Twitter earlier in the day , however . \u201c I will easily & quickly win Georgia if Governor @BrianKempGA or the Secretary of State permit a simple signature verification ... Why are these two \u2018 Republicans \u2019 saying no ? \u201d Trump wrote on Twitter . After Kemp responded that he had \u201c publicly called for a signature audit three times , \u201d Trump said that was n\u2019t good enough , and added in a second tweet that Kemp should immediately call a special session of the state legislature . \u201c Your people are refusing to do what you ask . What are they hiding ? \u201d Trump said . In a move unprecedented in modern U.S. history , the Trump team has tried , without success , to get Republican-controlled legislatures in battleground states won by Biden to set aside the results and declare Trump the winner . Biden won the election with 306 Electoral College votes - more than the 270 required - to Trump \u2019s 232 . The Electoral College will meet on Dec. 14 to formalize the outcome . Slideshow ( 4 images ) Trump told the Saturday rally his challenge was headed to the U.S. Supreme Court \u201c very shortly , \u201d without elaborating . Legal experts do not see a path to the nation \u2019s highest court , however . Richard Hasen of the UC Irvine School of Law said it was unclear what case Trump was referring to , but added : \u201c I do n\u2019t think any of these efforts stand any chance of success . \u201d Trump \u2019s penchant for making his political rallies all about him - and now , about his claims the U.S. electoral system is rigged - had raised concerns among some Republicans that his appearance in Georgia could end up turning voters off or making them feel there is no point in voting . Before the rally , Matt Towery , a former Georgia Republican legislator who is now a political analyst and pollster , said Trump could help if he praised the candidates , but warned : \u201c If he talks about them for 10 minutes and spends the rest of the time telling everyone how terrible Brian Kemp is , then it will only exacerbate things . \u201d When Loeffler and Perdue briefly took the stage and were handed the microphone by Trump , many in the crowd drowned out their words with chants of \u201c Fight for Trump ! \u201d Two pro-Trump lawyers , L. Lin Wood and Sidney Powell , have argued that Georgians should not vote in the runoff until issues from the 2020 election are resolved in the state , even after lawsuits they have filed to overturn the results have failed . Trump said on Saturday that voters could and should refuse to accept what he called the \u201c rigged \u201d presidential election results while also casting ballots for Perdue and Loeffler in the runoffs . \u201c If you do n\u2019t vote , the socialists and the communists win , \u201d he said . \u201c We can fight for the presidency and fight to elect our two great senators , and we can do it at the same time . \u201d", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 8, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valdosta,_Georgia"}, {"start": 11, "end": 18, "tag":

Slideshow ( 2 images ) Health Minister Enrique Paris said the measure , which will involve a full lockdown on weekends and restricted activities during the week , was designed to avoid a full quarantine . The coronavirus first hit Chile , population 19 million , in March , and the country reached a peak in June , with more than 5,000 cases daily and ranking only behind Qatar globally for cases per capita . In August , authorities began lifting the lid on lockdowns covering the capital suburb by suburb , using a step-by-step rule , while the focus of cases bounced from the mine-heavy north of the country to the south , where hospitals continue to be saturated . However , a steady uptick in cases that culminated in this week \u2019s 18 % rise has prompted a change in strategy .

Larisa Sayenko MINSK 1996-08-30 A senior Belarus politician accused President Alexander Lukashenko on Friday of attempting to set up a dictatorship in the former Soviet republic. The speaker of the Belarus parliament, Semyon Sharetsky, told Reuters that a draft constitution, due to be put to a national referendum on November 7, would dangerously increase the powers of the ruler. \"The world community should not be indifferent to the fact that President Lukashenko, who leads this European state of 10 million people, is trying to establish a dictatorship with his new constitution,\" Sharetsky said. The new constitution calls for a two-chamber parliament with a 110-seat majority-elected house of representatives and a regionally-represented senate with a third of its members named by the president. Lukashenko's aides shrugged off Sharetsky's charge. \"If there was a dictatorship they would n't have the right to say things like this,\" Sergei Posukhov, Lukashenko's political adviser, told Reuters. \"The people have asked us to establish order and that's our main aim.\" Lukashenko, 41, won presidential polls in 1994 on promises to restore order, fight corruption and repair the strong links with Russia that were disrupted by the collapse of the Soviet Union. But during his period in office he has battled against nationalist opponents, trade unions and parliament and Sharetsky said the current parliament was ready to try to impeach him. \"This constitution, which has been prepared in secret, aims to gather all power in one man's hands,\" he said. \"We should not be fooled by his quasi-democratic rhetoric and his methods, like this referendum.\" Lukashenko signed a pact with Moscow in April to create a strong economic and political union which he believes could grow into a federation. But nationalist groups, scared by the prospect of renewed Moscow domination and Russia's backing for Lukashenko, protested against the deal. Lukashenko responded by cracking down on the nationalist opposition and jailing nearly 200 people for taking part in demonstrations against the pact. The United States last week granted political asylum to two opposition leaders, Zenon Poznyak and Sergei Naumchik.", "value": [{"start": 4, "end": 11, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus"}, {"start": 56, "end": 61, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk"}, {"start": 82, "end": 89, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus"}, {"start": 119, "end": 139, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lukashenko"}, {"start": 203, "end": 209, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union"}, {"start": 239, "end": 246, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus"}, {"start": 282, "end": 289, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 497, "end": 507, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lukashenko"}, {"start": 524, "end": 532, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"}, {"start": 845, "end": 855, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lukashenko"}, {"start": 982, "end": 997, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergiyev_Posad"}, {"start": 999, "end": 1009, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lukashenko"}, {"start": 1036, "end": 1043, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 1116, "end": 1126, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lukashenko"}, {"start": 1243, "end": 1249, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}, {"start": 1293, "end": 1305, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union"}, {"start": 1696, "end": 1706, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lukashenko"}, {"start": 1726, "end": 1732, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow"}, {"start": 1918, "end": 1924, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}, {"start": 1939, "end": 1949, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lukashenko"}, {"start": 1979, "end": 1989, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lukashenko"}, {"start": 2133, "end": 2146, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}]}, {"text": "Slideshow ( 5 images ) BEIRUT ( Reuters ) - Renowned jazz trumpeter Ibrahim Maalouf delighted crowds on Friday with a concert in Beirut , bringing life to an area battered by Lebanon \u2019s economic meltdown and the catastrophic Aug. 4 port explosion . \u201c Because of what is happening now in the region and in Lebanon , it makes it even more important to be here , to play music in the streets , in the venues , \u201d Maalouf , a French-Lebanese citizen born in Beirut , told Reuters .

Yuri Kushko TAVILDARA, Tajikistan 1996-08-30 Tajik government troops now control of the strategically vital town of Tavildara after driving out Islamic rebels, but sporadic gunfire still echoed in the nearby Pamir mountains on Friday. The commander-in-chief of Tajikistan's armed forces, Major-General Nikolai Sherbatov, took a group of journalists by helicopter to the remote, and now devastated, town to show that his forces held it. He said his troops took Tavildara without casualties on August 23, but the crack of sniper and machinegun fire revealed the presence of opposition fighters in the surrounding mountains. Sherbatov said the rebels were located about three km (two miles) east of Tavildara around the village of Layron. Tavildara, 200 km (120 miles) east of the capital Dushanbe, was in ruins. Shells had smashed roofs and windows and empty shell cases littered the streets. The town straddles a strategically important road linking government and rebel-held territory and has fallen succesively to both sides in a bloody tug-of-war which began last February. Tajikistan, which borders Afghanistan and China, has been split by a dragging four-year conflict after a civil war between communists and a frail coalition of Islamic and liberal groups. Tens of thousands of people have been killed and many more have been displaced in the fighting, which breached a shaky United Nations-sponsored ceasefire. Tavildara is now apparently inhabited only by a few old men, women and their grubby, barefoot children. Fruit remained on the trees as there was no one to pick it. \"Help me, help me,\" said a chorus of women begging soldiers for food. The town's school and a shop doubling as a warehouse for humanitarian aid were destroyed in the fighting. \"We had to build our own earth shelters to survive the fighting,\" said Rajab Adinayev, a bearded elderly Tajik in a long white shirt. Although shy in front of the government soldiers, several inhabitants accused government forces of widespread looting of homes and livestock. They also said rebel fighters had looted medicines from the local hospital. One elderly man, who declined to give his name, said two of his sons were now refugees in Moscow and the other two had left to fight for the opposition. He also said government soldiers had raped the wife of one of his sons. \"It's not important who holds this town, we just need to stop the war,\" he said.", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 5, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajikistan"}, {"start": 54, "end": 63, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavildara"}, {"start": 65, "end": 75, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajikistan"}, {"start": 87, "end": 92, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajikistan"}, {"start": 158, "end": 167, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavildara"}, {"start": 186, "end": 193, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"start": 250, "end": 255, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamir_Mountains"}, {"start": 303, "end": 313, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajikistan"}, {"start": 502, "end": 511, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavildara"}, {"start": 738, "end": 747, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavildara"}, {"start": 778, "end": 787, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavildara"}, {"start": 828, "end": 836, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dushanbe"}, {"start": 1118, "end": 1128, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajikistan"}, {"start": 1144, "end": 1155, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan"}, {"start": 1160, "end": 1165, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"}, {"start": 1277, "end": 1284, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"start": 1424, "end": 1430, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"}, {"start": 1460, "end": 1469, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavildara"}, {"start": 1905, "end": 1910, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajiks"}, {"start": 2242, "end": 2248, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow"}]}, {"text": "Drugmakers Pfizer and Moderna are seeking emergency approval of COVID-19 vaccines , and the first doses could be administered to Americans as soon as this month .

ROME 1996-12-06 Italian Serie A games to be played on Sunday (league positions in parentheses, all kick- off times GMT) : Bologna (4) v Piacenza (13) 1330 Along with leaders Vicenza, fourth-placed Bologna represent the biggest surprise of this Italian autumn. Led as usual by Swede Kennet Andersson and Russian Igor Kolyvanov in attack, Bologna can expect a tough home match against a Piacenza side still exultant after a 3-2 league win over AC Milan last Sunday. Cagliari (16) v Reggiana (18) 1530 Cagliari start favourite in this relegation scrap following draws with Napoli and Inter in last two outings but will be without suspended Swiss defender Ramon Vega. Bottom team Reggiana are also without a suspended defender, German Dietmar Beiersdorfer. Fiorentina (10) v Perugia (8) 1330 Fiorentina will be without three suspended players-- defenders Daniele Carnasciali and Lorenzo Amoruso and midfielder Emiliano Bigica-- for a difficult home match against unpredictable, attack-oriented Perugia led by in-form Croat striker Milan Rapajic and the experienced Fausto Pizzi. Lazio (12) v AS Roma (7) 1930 Poor man's Roman derby in what has been a miserable season for both Rome teams, already eliminated from the Italian and UEFA Cups. Lazio have injury doubts about striker Pierluigi Casiraghi, Czech midfielder Pavel Nedved and defender Paolo Negro, while Roma present a full strength side led by Argentine Abel Balbo, Marco Delvecchio and Francesco Totti in attack. AC Milan (9) v Udinese (11) 1330 Can Milan sink any further? Following their midweek Champions ' League elimination by Norwegian side Rosenborg, a morale-boosting win is badly needed. Liberian striker George Weah makes a welcome return for Milan alongside Roberto Baggio, with Montenegrin Dejan Savicevic in midfield. Good news for Milan is that Udinese's German striker Oliver Bierhoff is out through injury. Napoli (5) v Verona (17) 1330 In-form Napoli should prove too strong for second from bottom Verona despite the absence of their suspended Argentine defender Roberto Ayala. Verona's slim chances have been further reduced by a knee injury to their experienced midfielder Eugenio Corini. Parma (14) v Atlalanta (15) 1330 Parma may field new signing, Croat midfielder Mario Stanic, in an attempt to lift a miserable season which has seen them go without a win since a 1-0 triumph over Cagliari eight weeks ago. Parma's French midfielder Daniel Bravo and defender Fabio Cannavaro are suspended while Argentine Nestor Sensini is out through injury. Atalanta look to Filippo Inzaghi, scorer of eight goals. Sampdoria (6) v Juventus (3) 1330 All-conquering Juventus field their most recent signing, Portuguese defender Dimas, while Alessandro Del Piero and Croat Alen Boksic lead the attack. The new world club champions may prove too strong for a Sampdoria side led by captain Roberto Mancini but missing injured French midfielder Pierre Laigle. Vicenza (1) v Internazionale (2) 1330 Not exactly a clash of the titans but an intriuguing match nonetheless. Full strength Vicenza, led by Uruguayan Marcelo Otero, may continue their surprise run at the top against an Inter side that has been less than impressive in three successive home draws. Inter will be without suspended French defender Joceyln Angloma and injured Chilean striker Ivan Zamorano.", "value": [{"start": 9, "end": 16, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"}, {"start":

Emese Bartha BUDAPEST 1996-08-30 Shares of France-registered printed packaging company Cofinec S.A. plunged sharply on the Budapest Stock Exchange (BSE) on Friday, despite a mostly reassuring forecast by the group. Cofinec's Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) opened at 5,200 forints on the BSE, down 600 from Thursday's close, following the release of its first half results this morning. Cofinec CEO Stephen Frater told reporters in a conference call from Vienna on Friday before the opening of the bourse that he expects a stronger second half, although the group will not be able to achieve its annual profit goal. \"We will not achieve the full 37 million French franc (net) profit forecast,\" Frater said. \"Obviously, we cannot make up the unexpected decrease that has been experienced in the first half of the year.\" Frater declined to give a forecast for the full year, ahead of a supervisory board meeting next week. Cofinec, the first foreign company to list on the Budapest bourse, released its consolidated first half figures (IAS) this morning. In the conference call, Frater said he regarded Cofinec GDRs-- which are trading below their issue price of 6,425 forints-- as a buying opportunity. \"Obviously, at some point it represents a buying opportunity,\" Frater said. \"I think the reality is that we operate in emerging markets, emerging markets tend to be more volatile.\" \"My message is that the fundamental strategy of the company, its fundamental market position has not changed.\" The group, which operates in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, reported an operating profit before interest of 21.8 million French francs compared to 34.1 million in the same six months of 1995. Net profit for the January-June 1996 period was 2.1 million French francs, down from 10.3 million in the first six months of 1995, with the bulk of this decline attributable to the performance of Petofi, one of its Hungarian units. Cofinec said Petofi general manager Laszlo Sebesvari had submitted his resignation and will be leaving Petofi but will remain on Petofi's board of directors. \"Until a new general manager of Petofi is appointed...

DURBAN, South Africa 1996-12-06 At least four people have been shot dead in two suspected political attacks in South Africa's volatile Zulu heartland, police said on Friday. A police spokesman said two youths believed to be supporters of President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) had been killed when unknown gunmen opened fire at the rural settlement of Izingolweni on KwaZulu-Natal province's south coast on Thursday night. The victims were 18 and 20, he said, adding one other youth had been wounded in the shooting. In another attack, also on the province's south coast on Thursday night, two men were shot dead near Umkomaas. \"We suspect that these killings are linked to politics,\" spokesman Bala Naidoo told Reuters. There had been no arrests.

Klara Gajduskova PRAGUE 1996-12-06 Czech President Vaclav Havel on Friday welcomed the appointment of Madeleine Albright, who is of Czech extraction, as the United States ' first woman Secretary of State. In a statement Havel, who is recovering from cancer surgery, said : \"Madeleine Albright is a distinguished friend, a tested diplomat, and a true American of fine origins.\" \"I look forward to continuing our good relations... with the United States and with the first woman ever to hold the position of Secretary of State. I wish her well,\" Havel said in a statement to Reuters. Havel, who helped lead the \"velvet revolution\" that ousted the Communist regime in Prague in 1989, invited Albright, then working for a private foreign policy think tank, to advise his new democratic government in 1990. Havel had a small malignant tumour removed from his lung on Monday and is recovering in hospital. Albright, born Marie Korbelova to a Czechoslovak diplomat in 1937, fled with her family to the United States after the Communists came to power in a coup in 1948. As an academic, Albright studied and lectured on Europe's 20th century problems before becoming U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Czech diplomats, seeking to have their country included in the expected expansion of NATO, praised the selection of Albright, known to be a strong supporter of alliance's integration of former Soveit-bloc countries. \"The nomination... is a clear signal that one key of the lines of foreign policy will be the strengthening of the trans-Atlantic cooperation, a creation of strategic partnership between Europe and the US,\" Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec told Reuters. \"(Albright) is a convinced advocate of NATO enlargement and of stabilisation of security structures.\" Czech ambassador to the United Nations, Karel Kovanda, told the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes that Albright \"is a little light in our diplomatic heaven,\" but warned against expecting her to exert any influence in favour of the Czechs.", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 5, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V\u00e1clav_Havel"}, {"start": 14, "end": 19, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic"}, {"start": 27, "end": 35, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_Albright"}, {"start": 64, "end": 70, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague"}, {"start": 82, "end": 87, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic"}, {"start": 98, "end": 110, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V\u00e1clav_Havel"}, {"start": 149, "end": 167, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_Albright"}, {"start": 179, "end": 184, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic"}, {"start": 204, "end": 217, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 267, "end": 272, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V\u00e1clav_Havel"}, {"start": 321, "end": 339, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madeleine_Albright"}, {"start": 397, "end": 405, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 485, "end": 498, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 591, "end": 596, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V\u00e1clav_Havel"}, {"start": 620, "end": 627, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 629, "end": 634, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V\u00e1clav_Havel"}, {"start": 657, "end": 663, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velvet_Revolution"}, {"start": 712, "end": 718, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague"}, {"start": 849, "end": 854, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V\u00e1clav_Havel"}, {"start": 983, "end": 995, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia"}, {"start": 1042, "end": 1055, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1066, "end": 1076, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Czechoslovakia"}, {"start": 1159, "end": 1165, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"}, {"start": 1206, "end": 1210, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1229, "end": 1235, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"}, {"start": 1245, "end": 1250, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic"}, {"start": 1330, "end": 1334, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO"}, {"start": 1647, "end": 1653, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"}, {"start": 1684, "end": 1699, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Zieleniec"}, {"start": 1705, "end": 1712, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 1816, "end": 1821, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic"}, {"start": 1840, "end": 1854, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"}, {"start": 1886, "end": 1903, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mlad\u00e1_fronta_DNES"}]}, {"text": "Potent landmines found near Colombian presidency.

FASTEST LAP Russell may be back in a tail-end Williams for next Sunday \u2019s Abu Dhabi season-ender , depending on seven times world champion Hamilton \u2019s recovery from COVID-19 , but the stand-in made sure he stood out . Mercedes regular Valtteri Bottas , confirmed for next season , could be on borrowed time . Russell led both Friday practice sessions , qualified on the front row within milliseconds of polesitting Bottas , seized the lead at the start , comfortably had the measure of the Finn and set the fastest lap . Only a Mercedes tyre mix-up , an extra pitstop and then a late puncture after a charge back to second denied him a first victory . He ended up ninth . It was still , as Wolff recognised , a \u2018 monumental \u2019 performance . \u201c I gave it everything I had . I was managing the race at the start , I felt confident and comfortable in the opening laps , just managing the gap to Valtteri , \u201d said Russell . Three points were scant reward , even if the first in Formula One for the 2018 Formula Two champion after nearly two barren years with Mercedes-powered Williams . When he stepped out of the car , the hurt was real -- not just because he was wearing shoes a size too small to fit into the cockpit more easily -- but so too was the sense of achievement . \u201c Hopefully I \u2019 ve given Toto some problems to sort out for the future . I \u2019m happy . I \u2019m proud , \u201d he said .", "value": [{"start": 2, "end": 9, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 39, "end": 53, "tag":

CONGRESS. PRAGUE 1996-12-06 Saturday's national congress of the ruling Czech Civic Democratic Party (ODS) will discuss making the party more efficient and transparent, Foreign Minister and ODS vice-chairman Josef Zieleniec, said on Friday. \"Modernisation and more profesionalism of the party's structure, having financing of the party be more transparent... are absolutely fundamental,\" Zieleniec, who is also vice-premier in the government, told Reuters. He said after June general elections in which the ruling three-party coalition lost its parliamentary majority, the ODS executive, led by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, had developed proposals on these subjects to present at the congress on Saturday in the Czech second city Brno. \"I am convinced, that the congress will tackle these proposals,\" he said. The ODS, a party in which Klaus often tries to emulate the style of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, has been in control of Czech politics since winning general elections in 1992. Zieleniec in the summer led calls for the party and its leadership to listen to more diverse opinions, a thinly-veiled criticism of Klaus who has spearheaded the country's post-Communist economic reforms. The party, led by the vigorously-confident Klaus, took 32 of 81 seats after late November runoff elections to the new upper house of Czech parliament. But after the first round vote a week before, the ODS had the potential to win as many 79 seats. Klaus and his coalition lost its majority in parliament in June lower house elections after the left-wing opposition consolidated, putting the centre-left Social Democrats in a strong second-place position.-- Prague Newsroom 42-2-2423-0003", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 5, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic"}, {"start": 51, "end": 57, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague"}, {"start": 112, "end": 140, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_Democratic_Party_(Czech_Republic)"}, {"start": 230, "end": 233, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_Democratic_Party_(Czech_Republic)"}, {"start": 248, "end": 263, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Zieleniec"}, {"start": 428, "end": 437, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Zieleniec"}, {"start": 488, "end": 495, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 613, "end": 616, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_Democratic_Party_(Czech_Republic)"}, {"start": 650, "end": 662, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V\u00e1clav_Klaus"}, {"start": 752, "end": 757, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic"}, {"start": 770, "end": 774, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno"}, {"start": 854, "end": 857, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_Democratic_Party_(Czech_Republic)"}, {"start": 876, "end": 881, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V\u00e1clav_Klaus"}, {"start": 925, "end": 932, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 948, "end": 965, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Thatcher"}, {"start": 990, "end": 995, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic"}, {"start": 1046, "end": 1055, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Zieleniec"}, {"start": 1178, "end": 1183, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V\u00e1clav_Klaus"}, {"start": 1294, "end": 1299, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V\u00e1clav_Klaus"}, {"start": 1384, "end": 1389, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic"}, {"start": 1499, "end": 1504, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V\u00e1clav_Klaus"}, {"start": 1654, "end": 1670, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Social_Democratic_Party"}]}, {"text": "Cambodian opposition newspaper editor pardoned.

Marcin Grajewski WARSAW 1996-12-06 Poland said on Friday that Swiss bank accounts, which in many cases belonged to Polish Jews who died in the Holocaust, were used in debt settlements between the two countries after the World War Two. Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati, unveiling first findings of a special government commission, said that in 1970s the then communist Poland received 460,000 Swiss francs from the accounts. \"In 1970s, Poland received from unclaimed accounts in Switzerland a sum of 460,000 francs. What was its right (to the money)...I do not know,\" Rosati told a news conference. Switzerland stands accused by Senator Alfonse D'Amato, chairman of the powerful U.S. Senate Banking Committee, of agreeing to give money to Poland from unclaimed bank accounts of Polish citizens, as part of an accord on compensating Swiss nationals whose assets had been seized in communist Poland. Many of these citizens were Jews murdered during the war, when Nazi German invaders killed most of Poland's 3.5 million Jews. Rosati did not say whether the payment in 1970s was part of the 1949 agreement between Warsaw and Switzerland on compensation to Swiss citizens whose assets were seized by the Soviet-imposed communists authorities after World War Two. \"I expect that the commission will finish gathering information within two to three weeks and then more details will be provided,\" Rosati said. Rosati confirmed that the 1949 agreement had provided for granting Switzerland about 53 million francs and most of this sum was repaid with coal exports. He said, however, that Switzerland did get about 16,000 francs from the so-called \"dead accounts\" as part of the compensation. \"About 16,000 francs were seized from accounts of four or five Polish citizens, whose data we do not precisely know. The issue is of moral and legal nature, because its financial significance is small,\" Rosati said. Under pressure from international Jewish organisations, Swiss government has devised a plan to pay out millions of dollars in unclaimed bank accounts as a conciliatory gesture toward Holocaust victims.

Mishi Saran HONG KONG 1996-08-30 Far East gold traders thumped foreheads in frustration at the market's foot-dragging this week and forecast on Friday that next week would not be much better. The Southeast Asian gold market was more or less a photo-fit picture of the previous week's position with activity slow and bullion prices trapped in a well-worn range awaiting a seasonal upturn in demand and prices into the fourth quarter. Singapore premiums for Australian kilo bars were quoted unchanged at between 25-45 cents an ounce over spot loco London prices, with South Korean and Indonesian-origin premiums also steady at 10-20 cents an ounce. Singapore dealers said they were concerned that there had been a marked revival in offers to sell gold by South Korean traders, following the distress sales of recent months after the Seoul government's crackdown on bullion arbitrage trade. \"I was shocked to see these offers coming in again, though there's been no indication of price or volume. I dread to think what will happen to the premiums if the Koreans start selling in force,\" one dealer said. Continued dishoarding of kilo-bars by Indonesian sources ahead of next year's presidential election has also kept a lid on premiums. Gold closed down at $ 387.00 / $ 387.50 an ounce in Hong Kong on Friday, versus New York's $ 387.60 / $ 388 finish on Thursday. Dealers said the precious metal eased on a report that the International Monetary Fund might sell some of its gold to reduce the debts of the poorest developing countries. Easier silver prices mid-week helped keep spot gold locked in a $ 386 - $ 389 an ounce range, dealers said, but they remained optimistic that the usual seasonal pick-up in jewellery fabrication demand would see gold at $ 395 by end-October. \"I still think we'll see gold at $ 395 by the end of October, in a retracement of the $ 418 - $ 380 move we saw at the start of the year,\" one said.

Steven Silber WARSAW 1996-12-06 Polish brewer Zywiec's 1996 profit slump may last into next year due in part to hefty depreciation charges, but recent high investment should help the firm defend its 10-percent market share, the firm's chief executive said. Company President Jean van Boxmeer told Reuters in an interview on Friday that the firm, whose net profit fell 77 percent in the first 10 months of 1996 despite a 30-percent rise in sales, might only post slightly better profits in 1997 before having a chance to make a more significant turnaround. So far this year Zywiec, whose full name is Zaklady Piwowarskie w Zywcu SA, has netted six million zlotys on sales of 224 million zlotys. It has produced 1.5 million hectolitres. Van Boxmeer would not say how much higher 1997 profits or market share could be but said sales of leading Polish brewers should rise as the country's young urban professionals gradually switch from vodka to beer. \"The perspective on growth is such that reasonably we can think that somewhere between 65 and 80 litres per year is certainly reachable,\" van Boxmeer said on Polish per-capita beer consumption, currently around 40 litres. He said the 65-80-litre level could be reached in the next ten years and make Poland, with its 40-million population, Europe's third largest beer market after Germany and Britain. Van Boxmeer said Poland's top five brewers, which produce about 55 percent of the country's beer, could all raise market share as some of the numerous small brewers fall to competition from the large brewers with foreign investors. Zywiec is 31.8-percent owned by Heineken while Carlsberg has the same amount in Okocim. Earlier this year South African Breweries Ltd (SAB) bought strategic stakes in the unlisted Lech and Tychy brewers, which together hold more than 20 percent of the market, and Australia's Brewpole BV has a controlling stake in Poland's larges t brewery, Elbrewery Company Ltd. (EB). Van Boxmeer said the tough competition had prevented Zywiec from raising prices in line with inflation, which had added to the pressure on the firm's margins. He said advertising costs would also increase in the fight for market share. But he said the company's investment of more than $ 100 million already this decade, largely in production, would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring Czech Republic. Some analysts say cheaper but high-quality Czech imports could invade Poland once tariffs for CEFTA countries are lifted in 1998, but van Boxmeer says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the Czech beer market's overcapacity. \"I think Polish consumers in general are quite proud of their beers-- and I'm speaking about all the brands-- and as we make good beers... I think that this fidelity to our beers is a factor which can limit the Czech beers,\" he said. Van Boxmeer said Zywiec had its eye on Okocim, which has said it would start producing Carlsberg beer next year, but that Zywiec's potential production of Heineken was a medium-term possibility rather than a short-term one. He said his firm would be better off concentrating on its leading brand, Zywiec Full Light, which accounts for 85 percent of sales and is the country's largest-selling brand. \"You will not win the war of the Polish beer market with imported international brands,\" van Boxmeer said, adding that Heineken would remain an up-market import in Poland. Van Boxmeer also said Zywiec would be boosted by its recent shedding of soft drinks which only accounted for about three percent of the firm's overall sales and for which 7.6 million zlotys in provisions had already been made.-- Warsaw Newsroom+48 22 653 9700", "value": [{"start": 56, "end": 62, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw"}, {"start": 74, "end": 80, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 339, "end": 346, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 883, "end": 889, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 1148, "end": 1154, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 1290, "end": 1296, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 1330, "end": 1336, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"}, {"start": 1371, "end": 1378, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"}, {"start": 1383, "end": 1390, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 1409, "end": 1415, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 1656, "end": 1664, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heineken_International"}, {"start": 1671, "end": 1680, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlsberg_Group"}, {"start": 1730, "end": 1757, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_Breweries"}, {"start": 1888, "end": 1897, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"}, {"start": 1939, "end": 1945, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 2428, "end": 2442, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic"}, {"start": 2487, "end": 2492, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic"}, {"start": 2514, "end": 2520, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 2538, "end": 2543, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Free_Trade_Agreement"}, {"start": 2642, "end": 2647, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic"}, {"start": 2685, "end": 2691, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 2887, "end": 2892, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic"}, {"start": 2997, "end": 3006, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlsberg_Group"}, {"start": 3065, "end": 3073, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heineken_Pilsener"}, {"start": 3342, "end": 3348, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 3428, "end": 3436, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heineken_Pilsener"}, {"start": 3473, "end": 3479, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}]}, {"text": "Tripoli decks out for coup celebrations.

They say the politicians will need to promote legislation that helps the economy without scaring the socks off financial markets. \"The worst thing that could happen for financial markets is that if Clinton and Dole start to trade shots in the middle of the ring with one-upmanship,\" said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. \"That's when Wall Street will need to worry.\" He said that the bond market would be the first to react if the \"bidding\" intensifies and stocks would quickly drop as interest rates rise. \"I do n't think it would imply the collapse of the stock market, unless the rise in rates touches off a dynamic within the market, which would include selling by portfolio managers, redemptions by individuals of mutual funds that would, in turn, pressure the portfolio managers to sell even more stock.\" This week, the market weighed Dole's proposal to lower federal income taxes by 15 percent across the board, a package that carries a price tag of $ 548 billion. Clinton proposes an $ 8.4 billion re-election agenda that would spare most home-sellers from capital gains taxes and give employers tax incentives to hire people off the welfare rolls. Clinton claims Dole's plan would increase the deficit, while the White House said some corporate taxes would be raised to offset the cost of the president's plan. The experts said there are some unusual risks for the market from this year's political season because the rush to promise tax cuts to win votes could upset Wall Street's expectations that Washington will balance the budget. \"The stock market will have to edit the promises and then do a probability study on those edited promises,\" said John Geraghty at the consulting firm North American Equity Services. During the past four presidential elections, the candidate that has favoured tax cuts has won. Ronald Reagan's tax cut won him a second four-year term in the White House in 1984, while Democrat Walter Mondale, who promised higher taxes, lost. George Bush became president in 1988 on his no-new-tax campaign and Clinton won in 1992 with a promise to fatten workers ' paychecks. The trick, they said, will be for the candidates to continue to convince Wall Street that the Treasury's 30-year bond-- the most closely-watched interest rate-- will fall to between 4 percent and 5 percent by the end of the decade. Johnson said that long-term interest rates have already been spooked by the election. The long-term bond jumped this week to 7.13 percent after starting the year at 5.95 percent. The surge of buying in stocks during the last two years has come amid an environment of low interest rates, which has boosted corporate profits. But the market stalled this summer after the Dow Jones industrial average set a record high of 5,778.00 points on May 22. \"The market does n't seem to be able to make new highs and it has been back and forth in a fairly horizontal mode which looks like a holding pattern,\" said Geraghty. He said the market reflects the political uncertainty, now that Dole has sharply narrowed the gap with Clinton in the polls. Geraghty said that the one thing that could completely turn the election around are new findings in the Whitewater scandal that would damage the Clintons. \"Stocks are on a delicate edge because if something happens that looks like it could upset the presidency, it could throw the political and, to some extent the economic, process into chaos,\" Geraghty said. Right now, Wall Street is pondering the candidates. \"We have an election where there are so many unknown variables that most people will probably want to hold fire, and even take the chance that they will have to pay higher prices for stocks after the November election, than take the risk that a shock to the system will hurt the stock market,\" Geraghty said.

Glenn Somerville WASHINGTON 1996-08-30 Factory orders rose in July and manufacturing surged in the Midwest in August, reports said Friday, sparking worries about inflation that battered financial markets for a second straight day. The Commerce Department said orders for manufactured goods climbed 1.8 percent in July to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion-- nearly twice the increase that had been expected. Shipments of everything from new cars to food items rose, as did order backlogs, in a sign that the strength in the industrial sector would continue in coming months. A separate report from Chicago area purchasing managers underlined the strength in manufacturing as the group's barometer of manufacturing in the region jumped to 60 in August from 51.2 in July. A reading above 50 indicates growth in manufacturing. While production and orders rose at Midwest area businesses, the prices they paid for goods used in manufacturing remained well in check. Analysts said the reports implied the economy was not slowing down in the third quarter after a burst of growth in the spring, and that the lull in late June and July was more temporary than Federal Reserve policy-makers had wanted. \"It appears that August is showing an economy again reversing course and is not moving onto a significantly slower track at this point,\" said economist Lynn Reaser of Barnett Banks Inc. in Jacksonville, Fla. The reports fanned worries on Wall Street that the Fed, the nation's central bank, would raise rates next month in a bid to ward off inflation, driving stock and bond prices sharply lower for a second day running. The 30-year Treasury fell almost a point, raising its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, to 7.12 percent from 7.04 percent late Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 31.44 points to 5,616.21 after a 64.73-point decline Thursday. A third report from the Commerce Department, on July personal income and spending, pointed to a potential slowdown in consumer spending that some analysts said may help moderate growth in the second half. It showed spending rose only 0.2 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June. Incomes from wages, salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June. July's slight gain in incomes was the weakest in six months, since January when they were flat. Economist Joel Naroff of First Union bank in Philadelphia said consumer spending, which fuels two-thirds of the nation's economy, may be much slower in the third quarter than in the first half, which should slow economic growth. \"The FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) has been forecasting a slowing in economic activity and moderating household demand will have a large impact on overall economic growth,\" Naroff said in a written comment. The policy-making FOMC is to meet on Sept. 24 to plot interest-rate strategy. It already has adopted a bias toward raising rates to keep a lid on wage and price rises and help sustain the 5-1 / 2-year-old economic expansion. In an interview on the cable television network CNBC Friday, Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence Lindsey said there still were \"mixed signals\" about the economy's direction. \"I think that, on balance, it is looking a little bit on the strong side,\" Lindsey said. He added that with expansion as solid as it is and with unemployment so low \"the greater risks are clearly that we might see some overheating.\" While July consumer spending rose only slightly, there were ample indications that consumers remained confident. The University of Michigan's August index of consumer sentiment, made available on Friday to paying subscribers, rose to 95.3 from 94.7 in July. Reaser said strong consumer confidence coupled with relatively lean inventories were providing manufacturers with a reason to gear up production. \"The economy is not going to be expanding at the 4.8 percent (annual) rate that we had in the second quarter but it is likely to keep expanding in the 3 percent range,\" she said, above the 2 percent to 2-1/4 percent that the Fed considers to be non-inflationary. New orders to factories were strong for durable goods like new cars and for nondurables like paper and food products. Orders for durable goods, meant to last three years or more, rose a revised 1.7 percent in July after falling 0.2 percent in June. Orders for nondurables jumped 1.8 percent following a 1.2 percent decrease in June.", "value": [{"start": 61, "end": 71, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C."}, {"start": 143, "end": 150, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States"}, {"start": 279, "end": 298, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce"}, {"start": 645, "end": 652, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"}, {"start": 907, "end": 914, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States"}, {"start": 1200, "end": 1215, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve"}, {"start": 1409, "end": 1426, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnett_Bank"}, {"start": 1431, "end": 1443, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida"}, {"start": 1480, "end": 1491, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange"}, {"start": 1501, "end": 1504, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve"}, {"start": 1832, "end": 1841, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average"}, {"start": 1953, "end": 1972, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce"}, {"start": 2562, "end": 2574, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia"}, {"start": 2757, "end": 2786, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee"}, {"start": 3233, "end": 3237, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC"}, {"start": 3246, "end": 3261, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve"}, {"start": 3271, "end": 3287, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_B._Lindsey"}, {"start": 3432, "end": 3439, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_B._Lindsey"}, {"start": 3707, "end": 3729, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan"}]}, {"text": "LONDON ( Reuters ) - After months of raising expectations for more stimulus to shore up a coronavirus-hit economy , it \u2019s time for the European Central Bank to deliver -- any package at Thursday \u2019s meeting that does n\u2019t pack a punch is likely to be met with disappointment . FILE PHOTO : The headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) are pictured in Frankfurt , Germany , July 8 , 2020 . REUTERS / Ralph Orlowski Southern European debt yields have fallen towards record lows , a sign of the confidence investors have that the ECB will announce further bond-buying . Here are five key questions for markets . 1. Will the PEPP be expanded and extended ? In a nutshell , yes . The ECB has flagged more emergency bond buying and cheap liquidity for banks and now the details of the package must be debated . Many economists expect the ECB to expand the 1.35 trillion euro ( $ 1.63 trillion ) Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme ( PEPP ) by another 500 billion euros and extend it by at least a further six months to end-2021 . A 12-month extension may also be considered . For a graphic on ECB set to increase and extend PEPP ? : 2. And TLTROs ? Officials are expected to make cheap long-term loans to banks known formally as Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations ( TLTROs ) , another primary policy tool , last longer . The ECB has already cut the rate on TLTROs to as low as minus 1 % and extended their duration to three years from two to encourage banks to finance firms even amid a deep recession . Economists expect an extension of the generous conditions . ECB officials may also debate an extension of the package of collateral easing measures beyond Sept . 2021 and an adjustment of the tiered rates system to further alleviate pressure on banks from negative rates .

Will the ECB discuss using the APP as part of the stimulus ? An expansion in the ECB \u2019s Asset Purchase Programme ( APP ) cannot be ruled out , although the PEPP will remain the key tool . According to a recent report , rate setters debated whether the ECB should extend the PEPP , given its unprecedented flexibility , or the regular APP , under which purchases should mirror the relative size of countries . Offering less generous support for indebted governments through APP could encourage them to apply for European Union loans tied to productive investments . It could also spur EU states to unlock aid . The EU \u2019s 750 billion euro recovery fund , vital for nations hit hardest by COVID-19 , has been blocked by Hungary and Poland , raising concerns that funding will be delayed . For a graphic on The ECB \u2019s QE programme : 4. How concerned is the ECB about the euro ? A rocketing euro is complicating the ECB \u2019s job as it could further harm the economy and suppress inflation . Against a dollar that appears to be entering a secular bear trend , the euro is near 2-1/2 year highs above $ 1.21 and close to its strongest in 11 years versus trading partners . Market positioning is not as stretched as it was in September when euro strength sparked verbal intervention . That suggests the rally has further room to run just as an economic surprise index for Europe is pulling ahead after lagging the United States for most of 2020 . \u201c Anything above $ 1.20 is likely to be a concern for the ECB -- so that is likely to be on their agenda and will be something they address in December , \u201d said VTB Capital \u2019s global macro strategist Neil MacKinnon . For a graphic on ECB to rein in euro ? : 5. Will the ECB \u2019s latest forecasts be cut ? Downgrades to economic growth and inflation forecasts , due on Thursday , are almost certain . The ECB expects euro zone inflation to keep falling this year and rebound more slowly in 2021 than previously anticipated even as COVID-19 vaccine hopes lift the growth outlook , according to ECB vice president Luis de Guindos . His comments suggest a cut to inflation forecasts is likely -- a prospect reinforced after euro area inflation remained negative for a fourth straight month in November .

Under the administration's proposal, the borders to the Mexican produce would be opened into 19 Northern and Northeastern states from November through February. The plan has raised a storm of protest from U.S. avocado growers, who are largely concentrated in California. California growers have charged that removing the restrictions, even on a limited basis, would endanger the $ 1 billion U.S. industry if potentially harmful Mexican insects were brought into the country along with the avocados. Mexican officials contend that there is no scientific basis for the ban, and that it is illegal under international trading rules of the World Trade Organisation. Proponents of the plan discount the worries of the U.S. growers and say the plan has enough safeguards built into it to eliminate any significant threat to American producers. Under the proposal, only imports of export-quality avocados growing in approved orchards in Michoacan, Mexico, the country's main avocado area, would be allowed. Mexican growers and distributors would have to abide by strict rules established by the Mexican and U.S. agriculture agencies. The California Avocado Commission-- which has spearheaded the opposition to lifting the ban-- said new data the group submitted to the Agriculture Department last spring shows the department underestimated the pest problem in Mexico and have urged that the agency reopen its study of the issue. The administration is still studying the new data, and officials have said that if experts think the information is significant, the agency could reopen its investigation. But U.S. avocado industry sources said that while they may have delayed the plan for a while, they ultimately do not expect the administration to change its position. \"From a common-sense view, the department should reconsider this plan, but due to politics they will probably go ahead with this,\" said Tom Bellamore of the California avocado group. Administration officials said they want to get the issue resolved as quickly as possible, but said there is no timetable they are working under. \"It's a very complicated issue,\" said the Agriculture Department's Drazek. \"We'll get it resolved as quickly as we can, based on the best available science.\"", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 7, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"}, {"start": 33, "end": 37, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 52, "end": 62, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C."}, {"start": 74, "end": 101, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture"}, {"start": 129, "end": 136, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"}, {"start": 187, "end": 198, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_United_States"}, {"start": 199, "end": 212, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 243, "end": 247, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 348, "end": 355, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"}, {"start": 481, "end": 493, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Glickman"}, {"start": 671, "end": 693, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture"}, {"start": 764, "end": 771, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"}, {"start": 838, "end": 845, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"}, {"start": 878, "end": 886, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_United_States"}, {"start": 891, "end": 903, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States"}, {"start": 987, "end": 991, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1041, "end": 1051, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"}, {"start": 1053, "end": 1063, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"}, {"start": 1173, "end": 1177, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1210, "end": 1217, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"}, {"start": 1281, "end": 1288, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"}, {"start": 1418, "end": 1442, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"}, {"start": 1495, "end": 1499, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1600, "end": 1608, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1712, "end": 1721, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michoac\u00e1n"}, {"start": 1723, "end": 1729, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"}, {"start": 1782, "end": 1789, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"}, {"start": 1870, "end": 1877, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"}, {"start": 1882, "end": 1886, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 2135, "end": 2141, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"}, {"start": 2380, "end": 2384, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 2700, "end": 2710, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"}]}, {"text": "FILE PHOTO : Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki deliver joint statements during their meeting in Budapest , Hungary , November 26 , 2020 .

CHICAGO 1996-08-30 Chicago Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, head of the second-largest U.S. Roman Catholic archdiocese, said on Friday his doctors had diagnosed him as having liver cancer and he had a year or less to live. Bernardin, 68, underwent extensive surgery for pancreatic cancer in June 1995 followed by months of chemotherapy, which he said made him more aware of his own vulnerabilities and the need to minister to the sick. \"On Wednesday, examinations indicated that the cancer has returned, this time in the liver. I am told that it is terminal and that my life expectancy is one year or less,\" a composed Bernardin told a news conference. In 14 years as Chicago's archbishop, he built a prayerful, saintly image and was deeply involved in world church issues and publicly committed to rooting out abuses by clergy. \"I have been assured that I still have some quality time left,\" he said, saying he would undergo a new form of chemotherapy but his doctors have told him there was only a slim chance of a cure and the liver cancer was inoperable. \"It's not going to be easy to say goodbye to everybody. Death does have some sad dimensions to it but I am a man of faith,\" he said. \"Death is a natural phenomenom.\" He said he would \"serve until the end\" as cardinal. Pancreatic cancer is among the most deadly forms of the disease, although Bernardin's case was caught early. Surgeons removed a cancerous kidney, parts of his pancreas and stomach, small intestine, bile duct and surrounding tissues. He made a rapid recovery and resumed most of his duties, but then developed a deteriorating condition in his spine that caused him great pain and shortened his height by several inches. He was scheduled to undergo back surgery next month, but that was cancelled when the cancer was discovered in his liver in order to avoid delaying the start of chemotherapy. The spare, soft-spoken son of an Italian stonecutter took over the Chicago archdiocese, the nation's second-largest after Los Angeles, with 2.3 million parishioners, in 1982. Ironically, Bernardin, who developed a progressive, much-praised programme to deal with pedophilia involving priests, became the highest-ranking church official ever accused of sexual improprieties when a former seminary student leveled charges in 1993 that he had been sexually abused by Bernardin during the 1970s. Bernardin steadfastly denied the charges and the former student later recanted his tale of abuse. Bernardin prayed with him before he died from AIDS last year. Bernardin, who became archbishop of Cincinnati in 1972, played an increasingly prominent role in the U.S. church as a moderate voice of compromise among liberals and conservatives in the ranks of the bishops. This month, he announced that he would oversee a series of conferences to find \"common ground\" among American Catholics. Previously, he was instrumental in drafting church policy on war, peace and nuclear arms, and for seven years he headed the bishops ' anti-abortion policy committee, espousing a policy describing human life as a \"seamless garment.\"", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 4, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 5, "end": 13, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_(Catholic_Church)"}, {"start": 14, "end": 23, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bernardin"}, {"start": 50, "end": 57, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"}, {"start": 69, "end": 76, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"}, {"start": 86, "end": 102, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bernardin"}, {"start": 131, "end": 135, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 136, "end": 150, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church"}, {"start": 267, "end": 276, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bernardin"}, {"start": 663, "end": 672, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Bernardin"}, {"start": 712, "end": 719, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"}, {"start": 1321, "end": 1338, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer"}, {"start": 1947, "end": 1954, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"}, {"start": 1981, "end": 1988, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"}, {"start": 2036, "end": 2047, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles"}, {"start": 2378, "end": 2387, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardin_Gantin"}, {"start": 2406, "end": 2415, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardin_Gantin"}, {"start": 2504, "end": 2513, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardin_Gantin"}, {"start": 2550, "end": 2554, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS"}, {"start": 2566, "end": 2575, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardin_Gantin"}, {"start": 2602, "end": 2612, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Cincinnati"}, {"start": 2667, "end": 2671, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 2876, "end": 2884, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 2885, "end": 2894, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_in_the_United_States"}]}, {"text": "Slideshow ( 3 images ) WELLINGTON ( Reuters ) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Monday vowed accountability for the families of last year \u2019s Christchurch mosque attack victims , ahead of the public release of a major report into the country \u2019s worst massacre .

Brad Dorfman CHICAGO 1996-08-30 The $ 9.5 billion proposed acquisition of Boatmen's Bancshares Inc. by NationsBank Corp. could spark a flurry of other mergers involving Missouri banks, which until last year were protected from outside buyers by state regulations. \"NationsBank just strolled into the Midwest and bagged the biggest banking trophy in the landscape,\" said Michael Ancell, banking industry analyst at Edward D. Jones & Co. \"Whoever wants a big market position in the Midwest has to come in and grab Mercantile or Commerce.\" St. Louis-based Mercantile Bancorp Inc., a bank holding company with $ 18.04 billion in assets, was seen by many analysts as the most attractive Missouri franchise in size after Boatmen's. Kansas City, Mo.-based Commerce Bancshares Inc., with $ 9.32 billion in assets, also could help a regional bank establish a strong presence in the lower Midwest, analysts added. \"It focuses more attention on Mercantile, Commerce and Roosevelt,\" said James Weber, analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons. Roosevelt Financial Group Inc is a $ 9.33 billion asset-St. Louis based thrift. \"Now... the most coveted bank out there is Mercantile,\" Weber said. Mercantile and Commerce did not return phone calls seeking comment. Among those seen as having an interest in buying in Missouri are Minneapolis-based First Bank System Inc. and Norwest Corp., Ohio-based KeyCorp and Banc One Corp., and First Chicago NBD Corp. in Illinois. Representatives of First Bank, Norwest, Banc One and First Chicago said the banks do not comment on rumors of possible mergers or acquisitions. KeyCorp, contacted by phone, would not comment. With a presence in nine states and $ 41 billion in assets, Boatmen's was the prize in Missouri, where barriers to outside acquirers were brought down last year by a federal banking statute. \"Boatmen's was the plum of Missouri and was the plum of the central Midwest,\" Weber said. Talk that the Missouri banks were seeking inflated prices from buyers was seen as a reason a deal has not occurred sooner. But NationsBank's bid, representing a premium of 40 percent for Boatmen's stock, was large enough to get the deal done. \"I think Boatmen's was shopping itself, and everybody knew if you wanted to be the winning buyer here, you had to make the bid nobody would beat,\" Ancell said. But some analysts cautioned that other targets should not expect as large a premium. They also questioned whether NationsBank can recoup shareholder value with such a large bid for Boatmen's. \"I think initially some stocks will trade up on sympathy, but the wild premium NationsBank put on this deal here, I do n't see a lot of other deals being done at this premium,\" said Michael Durante, analyst at McDonald & Co.", "value": [{"start": 54, "end": 61, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"}, {"start": 144, "end": 160, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NationsBank"}, {"start": 210, "end": 218, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri"}, {"start": 306, "end": 317, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NationsBank"}, {"start": 341, "end": 348, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States"}, {"start": 521, "end": 528, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States"}, {"start": 578, "end": 580, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis,_Missouri"}, {"start": 723, "end": 731, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri"}, {"start": 767, "end": 778, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri"}, {"start": 780, "end": 789, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri"}, {"start": 920, "end": 927, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States"}, {"start": 1122, "end": 1127, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis,_Missouri"}, {"start": 1330, "end": 1338, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri"}, {"start": 1343, "end": 1360, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis"}, {"start": 1388, "end": 1400, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwest"}, {"start": 1414, "end": 1421, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeyBank"}, {"start": 1426, "end": 1439, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_One_Corporation"}, {"start": 1473, "end": 1481, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois"}, {"start": 1514, "end": 1521, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwest"}, {"start": 1523, "end": 1531, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_One_Corporation"}, {"start": 1536, "end": 1549, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Chicago_Bank"}, {"start": 1627, "end": 1634, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KeyBank"}, {"start": 1761, "end": 1769, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri"}, {"start": 1892, "end": 1900, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri"}, {"start": 1933, "end": 1940, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States"}, {"start": 1969, "end": 1977, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri"}, {"start": 2082, "end": 2093, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NationsBank"}, {"start": 2472, "end": 2483, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NationsBank"}, {"start": 2629, "end": 2640, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NationsBank"}]}, {"text": "Slideshow ( 3 images ) DUBAI ( Reuters ) - Bahrain will not allow the import of Israeli goods produced in settlements in occupied Palestinian territory , state news agency BNA reported , disavowing comments made by the Gulf state \u2019s trade minister earlier this week .

Edna Fernandes LONDON 1996-12-06 The British government warned Friday that it would refer the proposed trans-Atlantic alliance between British Airways Plc and American Airlines to Britain's Monopolies and Mergers Commission unless the carriers complied with a number of conditions. Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang added that even if the conditions were met by both airlines, final clearance would hinge on an open skies deal between Britain and the United States to liberalise trans-Atlantic air traffic, which would create greater competition on the routes. Lang said he supported conditions proposed by Britain's Office of Fair Trading, which was asked to examine the case last month. \"I agree... that without suitable undertakings the alliance would be likely to lead to a significant loss of actual and potential passengers, on those routes where BA and AA currently compete and for all passengers on the trans-Atlantic market route between the UK and U.S.,\" he said. His comments came just minutes after the latest set of open skies talks ended in London with no deal signed. Industry sources said there was no new date for fresh talks and blamed the deadlock on uncertainty over whether the British Airways-American deal would be cleared. The conditions for clearance of the alliance were that British Airways and American drop 168 slots at London Heathrow airport, the busiest in Europe. American's parent, AMR Corp., said it did not view the terms as a \"deal breaker.\" However, it called the conditions \"more severe\" than those imposed by other regulatory authorities on similar airline alliances. British Airways's initial response was that \"unconditional divestiture of slots is unprecedented and if done it must be on the basis of fair market value.\" It added that it would be \"prepared to take reasonable steps to assist the introduction of additional competition.\" The government also wants British Airways to drop a clause in its agreement with USAir that bars it from competing on trans-Atlantic routes, and said both British Airways and American should be prepared to reduce services on the London to Dallas-Fort Worth route in the event that a new entrant wishes to enter. It also suggested losing some slots on the London-to-Boston route. The Office of Fair Trade called for British Airways / American to allow third-party access to their joint frequent flyer programme where the applicant does not have access to an equivalent programme. Lang said responses should be made to the Office of Fair Trading by Jan. 10, 1997.", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 7, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 33, "end": 41, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 67, "end": 73, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London"}, {"start": 89, "end": 96, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 187, "end": 202, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways"}, {"start": 211, "end": 228, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines"}, {"start": 232, "end": 239, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 363, "end": 371, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Lang,_Baron_Lang_of_Monkton"}, {"start": 491, "end": 498, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 507, "end": 520, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 617, "end": 621, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Lang,_Baron_Lang_of_Monkton"}, {"start": 663, "end": 670, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 673, "end": 695, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Fair_Trading"}, {"start": 1007, "end": 1009, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 1014, "end": 1018, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1111, "end": 1117, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London"}, {"start": 1255, "end": 1262, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways"}, {"start": 1358, "end": 1373, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways"}, {"start": 1378, "end": 1386, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines"}, {"start": 1405, "end": 1420, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Heathrow_Airport"}, {"start": 1445, "end": 1451, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"}, {"start": 1453, "end": 1461, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines"}, {"start": 1472, "end": 1480, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMR_Corporation"}, {"start": 1664, "end": 1679, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways"}, {"start": 1962, "end": 1977, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways"}, {"start": 2017, "end": 2022, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Airways"}, {"start": 2091, "end": 2106, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways"}, {"start": 2111, "end": 2119, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines"}, {"start": 2165, "end": 2171, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London"}, {"start": 2351, "end": 2366, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Airways"}, {"start": 2369, "end": 2377, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines"}]}, {"text": "U.S. tight-lipped on Libya's award to Farrakhan.

Lloyd Austin III during in a briefing from top military leaders while at U.S. Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa , Florida , September 17 , 2014 . REUTERS / Larry Downing Austin , who would be the first Black U.S. secretary of defense , was a surprise pick over Michele Flournoy , a former top Defense Department official who was considered the leading contender for the job . Flournoy would have been the first woman defense secretary . The news was first reported by Politico . Austin , who retired in 2016 , will need a waiver from Congress since it has been less than the required seven years since he served . He would be the second Pentagon chief in four years to need a waiver , after President Donald Trump picked James Mattis , a retired Marine general , to be his first defense secretary . The nomination of Austin , who headed U.S. Central Command under Obama , could draw fire from some progressive groups given his role in retirement on the board of a number of companies , including weapons maker Raytheon Technologies Corp . But Biden and Austin developed a working relationship during the Obama administration and the retired general has been advising the transition team on national security issues , one of the people familiar with the decision to name him said . Biden , who takes office on Jan. 20 , on Monday also announced key members of his health team to lead the administration \u2019s response to the raging coronavirus pandemic . Biden chose California Attorney General Xavier Becerra for secretary of health and human services and Dr. Rochelle Walensky , chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston , to run the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) . Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , was named as Biden \u2019s chief medical adviser on the virus . Biden \u2019s first major challenge in the White House will be containing a resurgent COVID-19 virus that has killed more than 283,000 Americans , and finding ways to jump-start an economy still reeling from millions of pandemic-fueled job losses . He installed Jeff Zients , an economic adviser here known for his managerial skills , as coronavirus \" czar \" to oversee a response that will include an unprecedented operation to distribute hundreds of millions of doses of a new vaccine , coordinating efforts across multiple federal agencies . Slideshow ( 2 images ) \u201c This team of world-class medical experts and public servants will be ready on Day One to mobilize every resource of the federal government to expand testing and masking , \u201d Biden said in a statement , adding they would \u201c oversee the safe , equitable , and free distribution of treatments and vaccines . \u201d DIVERSITY PUSH Biden \u2019s choice of Becerra , 62 , a Latino former congressman , adds a politician to a health effort that otherwise largely relies on government administrators and health experts . The choice also comes as Biden faces pressure to ensure diversity in his Cabinet appointments , including complaints from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus about the number of Latinos and from civil rights groups about the lack of Black nominees . Biden \u2019s decision to nominate the first Black defense secretary in Austin helps him make good on his diversity promise . It also will resonate among proponents for greater diversity in the leadership of the U.S. armed forces , which is regularly criticized for failing to promote Black servicemembers and whose top tier has been largely white . Austin has not cultivated a public persona and is not seen as someone who enjoys the media spotlight . However , he is known to be a shrewd military strategist with deep knowledge of the U.S. armed forces . Earlier on Monday , the Democrat who leads the House Armed Services Committee , Rep . Adam Smith , had openly shown his preference for Flournoy . \u201c I think Michelle Flournoy is hands-down the best-qualified person to do the job , \u201d Smith said . But David Segal , executive director of the progressive group Demand Progress , said Austin was a better choice given his role presiding over drawdowns of forces from Iraq and Afghanistan . And while he had some concerning ties to major companies like Raytheon , they were not as broad in scope as those of Flournoy . \u201c He does n\u2019t seem to have a web of entanglements that are as opaque and dense as hers , \u201d Segal told Reuters . Biden , a Democrat , has pressed ahead with the transition to the White House even as Trump , a Republican , refuses to concede the Nov. 3 election and wages a foundering effort to overturn the results with unsubstantiated claims of fraud . Dozens of Trump \u2019s legal challenges have been rejected by the courts , the latest on Monday when judges in Detroit and Atlanta tossed bids to decertify Biden \u2019s election victories in Michigan and Georgia . Biden won Michigan by about 154,000 votes and Georgia by about 12,000 votes . In Georgia , Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Monday certified the state \u2019s results , a statement said , after a third count confirmed Biden \u2019s win . The Electoral College will formalize results nationwide on Dec. 14 . Raffensperger , a Republican , said continued debunked claims about voting fraud were \u201c hurting our state . \u201d Runoff elections for Georgia \u2019s two U.S. Senate seats , scheduled for Jan. 5 , will determine which party controls the chamber .", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 10, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C."}, {"start": 13, "end": 23, "tag":

BONN 1996-08-30 The German government urged Israelis and Palestinians on Friday to avoid any course of action that might jeopardise the peace process in the Middle East. Israel announced this week the expansion of Jewish West Bank settlements surrounding Jerusalem and the demolition of an Arab community centre in East Jerusalem. City officials there said the centre was being erected illegally. But Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said the moves by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government were tantamount to war. Tension has been rising in the region since. \"We believe that the Israeli settlement policy in the occupied areas is an obstacle to the establishment of peace,\" German Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said. \"All concerned must avoid taking any course of action that could pose an obstacle to the peace process and which could make a peaceful solution difficult,\" he said, as news came of a renewed breakdown in Arab-Israeli peace talks in Jerusalem. Erdmann told reporters Bonn supported European Union efforts to persuade Israel to stop further Jewish settlement on the West Bank. The foreign ministry later announced Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy would visit Bonn for talks with his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel next month. The ministry said Levy and Kinkel would discuss the Middle East process and German-Israeli relations at their meeting on September 9. Levy's visit would be the first by an Israeli cabinet minister since Netanyahu's conservative government took power in une this year, the ministry said. Before Levy's arrival in Bonn, German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe will visit Israel from September 2 to 4, the defence ministry said. Ruehe planned to meet his Israeli counterpart Yitzhak Mordechai and Israeli President Ezer Weizman, the ministry said.

A Guinean man, detained in a round-up in the Saint-Bernard church a week ago, was deported on a scheduled Air France flight to Conakry after his appeals failed, a spokesman for Air France's pro-Socialist CFDT union said. He was apparently the eighth African deported from among 210 people evicted from the church after a 50-day occupation aimed at securing residence permits, unions said. Most of the others have been released after a brief stay in detention. About 100 people from the CFDT and the Communist-led CGT unions marched outside Air France headquarters at Charles de Gaulle airport north of Paris against the use of civilian jets and staff in deporting illegal immigrants. \"We must obtain a formal commitment from (Air France chairman) Christian Blanc that no plane, no personnel be used to transform our air companies into charters of shame,\" CFDT spokesman Francois Cabrera said. He said civilians should not be police accomplices. Twenty-three out of 25 charters flying illegal immigrants home since Prime Minister Alain Juppe's government took office in May 1995 have been civilian jets. The other two were military jets. Separately, Juppe confirmed the conservative government was preparing to submit a draft bill to parliament to tighten laws on illegal workers as part of a crackdown on immigration. \"Legislation is insufficient in several areas, notably in those concerning illegal work,\" Juppe told reporters.", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 6, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"start": 14, "end": 21, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"}, {"start": 23, "end": 33, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France"}, {"start": 50, "end": 55, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris"}, {"start": 67, "end": 73, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"start": 101, "end": 108, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"}, {"start": 142, "end": 147, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris"}, {"start": 168, "end": 178, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France"}, {"start": 256, "end": 263, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea"}, {"start": 360, "end": 370, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France"}, {"start": 381, "end": 388, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conakry"}, {"start": 431, "end": 441, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France"}, {"start": 458, "end": 462, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Democratic_Confederation_of_Labour"}, {"start": 504, "end": 511, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa"}, {"start": 740, "end": 744, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Democratic_Confederation_of_Labour"}, {"start": 767, "end": 770, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Confederation_of_Labour_(France)"}, {"start": 794, "end": 804, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France"}, {"start": 821, "end": 838, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris-Charles_de_Gaulle_Airport"}, {"start": 856, "end": 861, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris"}, {"start": 980, "end": 990, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France"}, {"start": 1001, "end": 1016, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Blanc"}, {"start": 1109, "end": 1113, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Democratic_Confederation_of_Labour"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1294, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alain_Jupp\u00e9"}]}, {"text": "Bob Dylan performs during the Firefly Music Festival in Dover , Delaware , U.S. June 17 , 2017 . REUTERS / Mark Makela NEW YORK ( Reuters Breakingviews ) - A hard rain may be falling on many musicians during the pandemic , but not on Bob Dylan . Universal Music said on Monday that its publishing division bought the 79-year-old songwriting legend \u2019s entire 600-plus catalog . The deal could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars . Selling now makes sense for the aging Nobel laureate , but his deal with an established industry player is unique . Greener artists getting offers for their work should think twice . Investors are increasingly interested in music royalties as an alternative asset . Shamrock Capital Advisors snapped up Taylor Swift \u2019s early master recordings for over $ 300 million in November , according to the Wall Street Journal . And $ 2 billion Hipgnosis Songs Fund has been shelling out an average of nearly $ 15 million a week since July 2018 for rights to songs by artists like Rihanna , accelerating its activity after Covid-19 hit . The investment case hangs partly on a continuing turnaround . Streaming services from Spotify Technology , Apple and others have revitalized the industry . U.S. recorded music sales posted a 13 % compound annual growth rate from 2015 through 2019 , according to Deloitte , with last year \u2019s revenue hitting a 10-year high . Royalty income can also be appealingly stable . For artists , there \u2019s pressure to sell . Important touring revenue has dried up in 2020 . This has surely left many needing shelter from the storm in the form of liquidity . And like U.S. equities and many other assets , music rights have been changing hands for higher-than-average multiples : around 10 to 18 times annual royalties versus 8 to 13 times in previous years , according to the Journal . Dylan is n\u2019t likely to benefit long-term from the streaming upturn , so it makes sense for him to cash out in a hot market . Fellow septuagenarian rocker Stevie Nicks recently sold an 80 % interest in her catalog at a roughly $ 80 million valuation , according to the New York Times . But younger or less famous acts need to be wary about unloading future income , not to mention finding their songs controlled by people they do n\u2019t like , as Swift has . Selling a few songs can meet immediate cash needs , but settling for a lump sum in a hurry could lead to serious regret . The present value now will later be past and , for the finances of music , the times they are a-changin \u2019 .", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 9, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan"}, {"start": 30, "end": 52, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_Music_Festival"}, {"start": 56, "end": 72, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dover,_Delaware"}, {"start": 75, "end": 79, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 97, "end": 104, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 119, "end": 127, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City"}, {"start": 130, "end": 151, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 234, "end": 243, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan"}, {"start": 246, "end": 261, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Music_Group"}, {"start": 473, "end": 478, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize"}, {"start": 738, "end": 750, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift"}, {"start": 832, "end": 851, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal"}, {"start": 1006, "end": 1013, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rihanna"}, {"start": 1149, "end": 1156, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify"}, {"start": 1170, "end": 1175, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc."}, {"start": 1219, "end": 1223, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1325, "end": 1333, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deloitte"}, {"start": 1619, "end": 1623, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1838, "end": 1843, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dylan"}, {"start": 1992, "end": 2004, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Nicks"}, {"start": 2106, "end": 2120, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times"}, {"start": 2281, "end": 2286, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift"}]}, {"text": "Cricket - Pakistan beat New Zealand by 46 runs.

Canada's 8.0 percent bond due 2023 fell C$ 0.45 to C$ 101.15 to yield 7.894 percent. The U.S. 30-year benchmark fell 30/32 to yield 7.12 percent. The spread between benchmark bonds narrowed 77 basis points from 81 basis points at the close of trading on Wednesday. Statistics Canada on Friday reported Canada's current account moved to a higher-than-expected C$ 1.15 billion second quarter surplus from a C$ 1.62 billion deficit in the first quarter. It was the first surplus since the fourth quarter of 1984. The agency also reported Canada's real gross domestic product rose a weaker-than-expected 0.3 percent in the second quarter or 1.3 percent at an annualized rate. While the data provided support for Canadian bonds, both Canadian and U.S. markets weakened after the release of strong U.S. economic data, including a report showing the Chicago Purchasing Managers August index rose to 60 from 51.2 in July. \"The purchasing managers ' number is extremely, extremely strong,\" said Webber. In other news, the Toronto Bond Traders ' Association said it is recommending that dealings in the Canadian bond market end early at 1400 EDT / 1800 GMT on Friday. The Canadian market typically closes early on holiday weekends and Canadian financial markets will be closed on Monday for Labour Day.

NEW YORK 1996-12-06 New York City on Friday said that it planned a $ 775 million refunding for January that will include its first floating rate issue of taxable debt for European investors. A city official, who declined to be named, explained that Goldman, Sachs, which this summer was demoted to the second tier of the syndicate, proposed the floating rate issue and as a result was promoted to book runner for this offering. By selling the floating rate debt, the city hopes to establish a benchmark, the city official said, adding that it needed a large deal to accomplish this objective. The city in late June sold its first issue of Euronotes, a strategy that it says saved it $ 500,000 in interest costs, and it has been trying to build on this strategy of expanding the pool of potential investors since then.

The FDA will have the final say . Dr. William Schaffner , an infectious disease expert and non-voting member of the CDC \u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) , said the gap between the two ACIP meetings will allow the FDA time to draft and issue an emergency use authorization ( EUA ) before the ACIP vote .

Pfizer last month said its vaccine \u2019s two-dose regimen was 95 % effective at preventing illness from COVID-19 and had no major safety issues .

The FDA released documents on Tuesday in preparation for Thursday \u2019s advisory committee meeting , saying the Pfizer vaccine \u2019s efficacy and safety data met its expectations for the authorization . The ACIP panel will have to make recommendations about several groups , including whether the vaccine should be used in adolescents aged 16 to 18 , and whether it should be used in pregnant women , who were excluded from Pfizer \u2019s late-stage trial . Schaffner , who represents the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases on the ACIP panel , said more than 300,000 healthcare workers are women who are pregnant or lactating .

Brendan Intindola NEW YORK 1996-12-06 Homestake Mining Co tops Wall Street's list as the most likely white knight buyer for Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp if Santa Fe rejects unsolicited suitor Newmont Mining Corp. Santa Fe is so far mum on the more than $ 2 billion stock swap takeover proposal from Newmont, announced Thursday. Wall Street, since the bid, has speculated that any deal between Newmont and Santa Fe would be a \"bear hug,\" or a reluctantly negotiated agreement where the buyer is not necessarily a friendly suitor. Newmont said the companies have had previous contact, though declined to detail the encounters. Analysts predict Santa Fe will go to the highest bidder, and that if a rival buyer is found, Newmont may not be able to match its offer. They said the Santa Fe deal, which includes desirable Nevada mining territory, would only payoff for Newmont longer term. Newmont, in fact, will not benefit from the Santa Fe acquisition on an earnings basis for at least two years, which also limits its capacity to raise its offer. Any deal, friendly or hostile, would almost assuredly be a stock swap, which is necessary to preserve the tax-free, pooling-of-interest accounting, they said. Analysts and arbitrageurs immediately ruled out Barrick Gold Corp and Bre-X Minerals Ltd as Santa Fe saviors because they are locked in negotiations over their splitting Indonesia's Busang vast gold deposit. Placer Dome Inc too was considered unlikley because it is focusing on geographic expansion in areas that do match Santa Fe's Nevada, South America and Central Asia presence, they said. A Homestake spokesman was not immediately available to comment on speculation that it tops the list. Homestake, based in San Francisco, operates gold mines in the United States, Australia, Chile and Canada. Earnings in 1995 were $ 0.22 per share, or $ 30.3 million, on revenues of $ 746.3 million. Santa Fe is headquartered Albuquerque, N.M. and reported 1995 earnings of $ 0.30 per share, or $ 40 million, on revenues of $ 350 million. Santa Fe has mining and exploration operations in Nevada, California, Montana, Canada, Brazil, Australia, Chile, Kazakstan, Mexico and Ghana. PaineWebber analyst Marc Cohen said he lowered his rating on Newmont to neutral from attractive today because if Newmont merged with Santa Fe, investors would have to wait until the second half of 1998 to realize earnings accretion. \"I think Homestake could come in as a white knight, but how much is someone willing to come in above the Newmont number. One would have to outbid by at least 15 percent, but there is going to be a (Santa Fe) deal with someone,\" he said. \"Longer term, two to three years out, (a Newmont-Santa Fe deal) is positive, it does all the right things. But in the near-term it is, at worst, neutral,\" the analyst added. Newmont proposed to Santa Fe a stock-swap merger at a ratio of 0.33 Newmont shares for each Santa Fe shares. In Friday New York Stock Exchange trade, Newmonth was off 1/2 to 46-5/8 while Santa Fe added 1/4 to 15-1/8. \"Newmont said it wants to discuss a friendly deal with Santa Fe, which is almost always a euphemism for ' We have more money in our pocket, '\" said an arb, referring to a possible sweetened bid from Newmont. Two other arbs called Newmont's move a \"a 32 cent bid\" because there is no formal tender offer, only the proposal letter \"mailed\" to Santa Fe's board.-- Wall Street Desk, 212-859-1734.", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 7, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange"}, {"start": 25, "end": 33, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico"}, {"start": 60, "end": 68, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City"}, {"start": 105, "end": 116, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange"}, {"start": 196, "end": 204, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico"}, {"start": 232, "end": 251, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newmont_Mining_Corporation"}, {"start": 253, "end": 261, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico"}, {"start": 339, "end": 346, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newmont_Mining_Corporation"}, {"start": 368, "end": 379, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange"}, {"start": 433, "end": 440, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newmont_Mining_Corporation"}, {"start": 445, "end": 453, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico"}, {"start": 569, "end": 576, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newmont_Mining_Corporation"}, {"start": 682, "end": 690, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico"}, {"start": 758, "end": 765, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newmont_Mining_Corporation"}, {"start": 816, "end": 824, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico"}, {"start": 856, "end": 862, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada"}, {"start": 903, "end": 910, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newmont_Mining_Corporation"}, {"start": 924, "end": 931, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newmont_Mining_Corporation"}, {"start": 968, "end": 976, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico"}, {"start": 1292, "end": 1309, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrick_Gold"}, {"start": 1336, "end": 1344, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico"}, {"start": 1414, "end": 1423, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia"}, {"start": 1577, "end": 1583, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada"}, {"start": 1585, "end": 1598, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America"}, {"start": 1603, "end": 1615, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia"}, {"start": 1758, "end": 1771, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco"}, {"start": 1800, "end": 1813, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1815, "end": 1824, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"}, {"start": 1826, "end": 1831, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile"}, {"start": 1836, "end": 1842, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"}, {"start": 1935, "end": 1943, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico"}, {"start": 1961, "end": 1972, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albuquerque,_New_Mexico"}, {"start": 1974, "end": 1977, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico"}, {"start": 2074, "end": 2082, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico"}, {"start": 2124, "end": 2130, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada"}, {"start": 2132, "end": 2142, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"}, {"start": 2144, "end": 2151, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana"}, {"start": 2153, "end": 2159, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"}, {"start": 2161, "end": 2167, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"}, {"start": 2169, "end": 2178, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"}, {"start": 2180, "end": 2185, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile"}, {"start": 2187, "end": 2196, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan"}, {"start": 2198, "end": 2204, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico"}, {"start": 2209, "end": 2214, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana"}, {"start": 2216, "end": 2227, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paine_Webber"}, {"start": 2979, "end": 3002, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange"}, {"start": 3132, "end": 3140, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico"}, {"start": 3276, "end": 3283, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newmont_Mining_Corporation"}, {"start": 3307, "end": 3314, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newmont_Mining_Corporation"}, {"start": 3418, "end": 3426, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe,_New_Mexico"}]}, {"text": "Israel blocks Palestinian pilgrims ' progress.

The PLO wants Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. Only a few Palestinians trickled to the roadblocks. They were immediately turned back. \"I am heeding Abu Ammar's (Arafat's) call to pray at al-Aqsa and I came. It is our duty towards al-Aqsa to come and pray,\" Jamil said. A tourist from Jordan was also told by Israeli soldiers at the al-Ram checkpoint that he could not enter Jerusalem. \"We have a peace treaty with them and we let them go wherever they want when they come to Jordan,\" said the tourist, Khaled Hijazi, 37. \"I feel terrible. I am entitled to see Jerusalem,\" he said. Some Palestinians took to back roads, only to run into waiting Israeli security forces. \"The Israelis have no right to prevent us from going to pray. What kind of peace is this that prevents us from reaching our holy places?\" asked Mustafa Hoshiyeh, a 27-year-old West Bank labourer turned around by a police patrol on a back road. \"Abu Ammar (Arafat) is right. We have signed a peace treaty with the Israelis but on the ground, we see that nothing has changed,\" said 20-year-old Ali Ahmed from Qalandia refugee camp.", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 6, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 14, "end": 25, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine"}, {"start": 67, "end": 76, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories"}, {"start": 126, "end": 133, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 168, "end": 179, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine"}, {"start": 195, "end": 208, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasser_Arafat"}, {"start": 230, "end": 239, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem"}, {"start": 242, "end": 249, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Mosque"}, {"start": 310, "end": 317, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 345, "end": 351, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language"}, {"start": 353, "end": 364, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Palestine"}, {"start": 375, "end": 381, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasser_Arafat"}, {"start": 393, "end": 399, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 421, "end": 427, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews"}, {"start": 458, "end": 467, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem"}, {"start": 485, "end": 496, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine"}, {"start": 546, "end": 551, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_people"}, {"start": 573, "end": 577, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip"}, {"start": 651, "end": 663, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine"}, {"start": 684, "end": 690, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 716, "end": 725, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories"}, {"start": 729, "end": 738, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem"}, {"start": 765, "end": 771, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"start": 806, "end": 812, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews"}, {"start": 846, "end": 853, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 879, "end": 888, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem"}, {"start": 937, "end": 943, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 1056, "end": 1067, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Palestine"}, {"start": 1086, "end": 1098, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine"}, {"start": 1189, "end": 1195, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasser_Arafat"}, {"start": 1215, "end": 1222, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Aqsa_Mosque"}, {"start": 1312, "end": 1318, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan"}, {"start": 1336, "end": 1343, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 1402, "end": 1411, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem"}, {"start": 1503, "end": 1509, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan"}, {"start": 1588, "end": 1597, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem"}, {"start": 1614, "end": 1626, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine"}, {"start": 1672, "end": 1679, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 1702, "end": 1710, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 1953, "end": 1959, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasser_Arafat"}, {"start": 2010, "end": 2018, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 2104, "end": 2112, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalandia"}]}, {"text": "JAKARTA , Dec 6 ( Reuters ) - Indonesia \u2019s anti-graft agency on Sunday named Social Affairs Minister Juliari Batubara as a suspect in a million-dollar bribery case , along with four other people .

Glenn Somerville WASHINGTON 1996-08-30 Consumer spending barely edged up in July, the Commerce Department said Friday, as income growth slowed abruptly to the weakest pace in six months. Spending rose 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 5.15 trillion after dropping a revised 0.4 percent in June. Incomes from wages, salaries and all other sources gained 0.1 percent to a rate of $ 6.47 trillion after a 0.9 percent jump in June. Department officials said July's slight gain in incomes was the weakest for any month since January, when they were flat. Wages and salaries came under pressure in July as a shorter average workweek and lower hourly earnings cut into paychecks. The department said wages and salaries decreased by $ 6.9 billion in July after climbing $ 45 billion in June. \"In July, average weekly hours and average hourly earnings declined, more than offsetting the effect of an increase in employment,\" Commerce said. But more money went into savings accounts, as savings held at 5.3 cents out of each dollar earned in both June and July. That was the highest savings rate since October last year, when 5.5 cents out of each dollar earned was being saved. The generally lackluster report on spending and incomes in July had been expected. At the same time, the department said in a separate report that new orders received by U.S. factories climbed strongly in July, with widespread gains across most major categories. Orders increased 1.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 317.6 billion, significantly stronger than the 1 percent rise forecast by Wall Street economists. That followed a revised 0.7 percent decline in June orders. Commerce said previously that spending at retail stores was up only 0.1 percent in July, partly because of softer sales of new cars and light trucks. In addition, the Labour Department's July employment report had foreshadowed the muted income growth. It showed average hourly earnings fell in July by 0.2 percent to $ 11.00 and the average workweek shortened to 34.3 hours from 34.7 in June. Gains in personal income, which includes wages and salaries as well as income from sources such as dividends, interest and businesses, are essential for funding consumer purchases, which fuel two-thirds of national economic activity. Spending on all types of durable goods, which includes cars, fell to an annual rate of $ 626.3 billion in July from $ 633.6 billion in June. But spending on nondurable products increased moderately to a rate of $ 1.55 trillion from $ 1.54 trillion in June, while spending for services was up to $ 2.97 trillion in July from $ 2.96 trillion. Payrolls of manufacturing companies rose in July by $ 2.3 billion to an annual rate of $ 678 billion.", "value": [{"start": 61, "end": 71, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C."}, {"start": 130, "end": 149, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce"}, {"start": 1403, "end": 1407, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1626, "end": 1637, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange"}, {"start": 1877, "end": 1894, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor"}]}, {"text": "California threw a wrench into 23rd-ranked Oregon \u2019s Pacific-12 Conference title hopes Saturday night , holding the Ducks scoreless in the second half en route to a 21-17 upset in Berkeley , Calif .

Jonathan Wright NAIROBI 1996-12-06 The Canadian general in charge of a multinational force for eastern Zaire said on Friday he was going back to Zaire for more information about the plight of about 165,000 Rwandan refugees adrift in the countryside. Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril told a news conference in Nairobi his main concern was for a large group of about 150,000 refugees living off the land in a valley about 65 km (40 miles) west of the eastern city of Goma. If he decided it was necessary and safe for the aircrew, he would not hesitate to order airdrops of food for the refugees, even against the wishes of the government in Kinshasa and the Zairean rebels who control much of eastern Zaire, he said. \"Tomorrow I'm going into Rwanda and my intention is to go across into eastern Zaire and try to find out for the second time what the situation is on the ground,\" he said. General Baril saw rebel leader Laurent Kabila in Goma last week but the rebels told him the crisis was over because most of the Rwandan refugees have already gone home. The rebels do not want the multinational force to deploy on the ground, for fear it might help the Zairean army regain control of the area. Kinshasa opposes airdrops, apparently because the food could fall into the hands of the rebels and their local supporters. Canadian Defence Minister Doug Young said on Thursday that the multinational force would probably not have to make food airdrops or intervene militarily in any major way. \"It does n't look as though they (airdrops) are going to be required in any significant way because the NGOs (non-governmental organisations) are in that area on the border between Zaire and Rwanda,\" Young told reporters. But General Baril said it would be premature to rule out any course of action until he had more information. \"We hope that if the front moves forward or stabilises then we will have access (to the large group of refugees) with reconnaissance or humanitarian agencies.\" If they ca n't move because they are too weak, then we will probably consider very seriously using air delivery means (airdrops)...It's complex, it's dangerous for the air crew that fly in there and it will have to be absolutely necessary. If it is necessary, I wo n't hesitate to use it, \"he said. Asked if he would disregard the objections of the Zairean government, he said :\" It would have to be in the last resort. It would have to mean that tens of thousands of lives are in danger. Do you think that I would have a conscience problem doing it or not at that time? And my mandate is also under Chapter Seven to operate in eastern Zaire. \"Under Chapter Seven of the U.N. charter, the Security Council has wide powers to preserve peace and security.\" I know their (the Zairean government's) position and I know it's very delicate and we are very sensitive to their position also, \"the general added. He denied that his contacts, criticised by Kinshasa, with the Zairean rebels amounted to negotiations.\" I do n't negotiate, \"he said.\" I coordinate with those who are holding ground and that's a wise thing to do. When we do n't know where the front is, we do n't know what the risk is. \"Baril said that apart from the group of 150,000, U.S. and British reconnaissance plans had tracked two much smaller groups of refugees-- one of up to 1,000 north of the town of Masisi and one of up to 8,000 on the road from Bukavu west to Kindu. The Kisangani office of the medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres said on Friday that more than 100,000 refugees were trekking northwest from the Goma-Bukavu area and many of them were now in the town of Walikale.

The dollar rose slightly against the German mark, but edged lower against the Japanese yen. The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 64.73 points at 5,647.65, its largest drop since July 15, when it closed with a loss of 161 points. In the broader market, declining issues beat advances 1,627 to 743 on moderate volume of 321 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. In the bond market, the 30-year Treasury bond fell 23/32 of a point, or $ 7.1875 on a $ 1,000 bond, raising its yield to 7.04 percent-- the highest since July 31-- from 6.98 percent at Wednesday's close. \"Seven percent creates psychological problems and a legitimate competitor for money from equities,\" said Ralph Bloch, chief technical analyst at Raymond James. \"We could carry another 100 points lower in the Dow,\" he said. \"I'm telling clients things are dicey going into next Friday (Sept. 6) so let's be careful.\" Wall Street on Sept. 6 faces the key monthly employment report, which has been known to cause dramatic swings in stock prices. \"We had two very strong economic reports,\" said David Shulman, Salomon Bros. ' chief equity strategist. \"There are more worries in bond land. Fears of a Fed tightening next month have resurfaced for the first time since the end of July.\" The Commerce Department reported that the nation's gross domestic product expanded at a 4.8 percent annual rate in the three months from April through June instead of the 4.2 percent estimated a month ago. In another report, sales of new homes jumped unexpectedly in July to the briskest rate in five months, driving prices up in a strong housing market. Sales shot up 7.9 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 783,000 units-- the strongest since February, when new homes were selling at a rate of 784,000 a year. Analysts said the stock market was also worried about the impact on President Clinton's re-election bid of his top political strategist resigning. Dick Morris, who is credited with resurrecting Clinton's political fortunes over the past 18 months by masterminding his turn to the political centre, quit after a supermarket tabloid reported he engaged in a yearlong affair with a prostitute, with whom he allegedly shared confidential campaign documents. Analysts said Wall Street had grown accustomed to a moderate Republican in the form of Democratic President Clinton. Morris ' departure raised fears that Clinton would veer more to the left in a second term. The dollar closed at 1.4772 marks, up from 1.4767 late Wednesday. The dollar slipped to 108.40 yen from 108.45. Oil markets rose sharply on a combination of low stocks, two hurricanes and allegations of illicit trading by Iraq. September heating oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed 1.63 cents higher at 63.67 cents a gallon, September unleaded gasoline finished 1.39 cents up at 63.72 cents a gallon and October crude rose 44 cents to $ 22.15 a barrel. December cotton closed 0.95 cent higher at 77.06 cents per pound on the New York Cotton Exchange despite some easing of concern about the twin hurricane threat to key U.S. growing areas with forecasts indicating both storms may remain offshore. Overseas, London's FTSE 100 index had earlier climbed to 3,8921.1 just below its record of 3,922.1, before edging down through the afternoon session to finish the day at 3,885.0, a fall of 33.7 points.

David Jones MILAN 1996-08-30 Italian tyre and cables giant Pirelli on Friday announced its long-awaited move into China with a cables joint venture set to capitalise on the rapidly-growing Chinese telecommunications market. Pirelli is linking with Hong Kong-based group CITIC Pacific in a venture to be called the Wuxi Tong Ling Company Ltd, which will operate in partnership with a local industrial company at its existing factory in Wuxi, Jiangsu province, Shanghai. The partners will invest around $ 30 million in the existing copper cable plant at Wuxi to update technology and include optic fibre production, with annual turnover expected to reach $ 60 million within the next few years. The move marks a further move by Pirelli's cables division to expand in the fast-growing Far Eastern developing markets with the group already present in Indonesia, India and Malaysia. \"This is really positive news for Pirelli, and I expect that it will produce one of the best half-year results in late September compared to other industrial Italian companies,\" said analyst Paula Buratti at Indosuez. She emphasised that the move was positive because Pirelli will have management control of the Chinese venture, and it also showed another example of Pirelli exporting its technical know-how to developing markets. Pirelli shares reacted favourable even though talks had been underway for some time and news about a venture had been widely expected. The shares rose 0.2 percent to 2,555 lire by 1350 GMT in an easier Milan stock market. This will be Pirelli's first industrial involvement in a Chinese market where demand for telecommunication networks is expected to grow to 80-100 million new lines between 1996 and 2000, doubling demand for optical cables. China's second largest telecoms operator Unicom already has a mandate from the central government to establish 15 million new phone lines by the year 2000, which will necessitate new trunk line systems and local distribution networks. \"The starting of this production base in China has for our group an undoubted strategic value, representing an important enhancement of our presence in Asia,\" said Pirelli SpA chairman and chief executive officer Marco Tonchetti Provera.

Slideshow ( 2 images ) Britain left the European Union on Jan. 31 but rules governing trade , travel and business have remained unchanged during a transition period which ends on Dec. 31 , when a new relationship will be established - with or without a deal . The talks between Johnson and von der Leyen could provide the political impetus to move the sides closer to bridging their substantial differences , or highlight how the \u201c red lines \u201d on both sides mean a deal remains out of reach . If the two sides fail to reach a deal , the five-year Brexit divorce will end messily just as Britain and Europe grapple with the vast economic cost of the COVID-19 outbreak . British and EU negotiators paused trade talks on Friday to call in their leaders to try to narrow the gaps and get an agreement after a week of negotiations failed to bridge significant divergences between the two sides . \u201c We keep calm , as always , and if there is still a way , we will see , \u201d EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier told broadcasters in London as he left for Brussels . Johnson was expected to speak to Barnier \u2019s UK counterpart David Frost and other officials on Saturday morning , ahead of the von der Leyen call . The pause in talks on Friday was the latest twist in months of negotiations which have barely moved on the three thorniest issues - fisheries , ensuring fair competition guarantees and ways to solve future disputes . Sources from both sides said that French demands over fishing rights in British waters remained a key issue . However , one EU diplomat said French President Emmanuel Macron was not the only one with reservations , and several member states had also raised concerns over how far Barnier had moved on competition issues , known as the level-playing field . \u201c It \u2019s not just Macron , \u201d the diplomat said . Britain says the EU must respect its sovereignty because the 2016 Brexit referendum result was a vote to \u201c take back control \u201d . But the EU says Britain \u2019s proximity to the bloc means it cannot offer the \u201c Canada-style \u201d free trade deal that Johnson had been seeking . Neither side has walked away from the talks yet , suggesting they still hold out some hope of securing a deal governing almost $ 1 trillion of annual trade to avoid a disorderly end to more than 40 years of British membership of the European club . In the absence of a trade deal , the United Kingdom would trade with the EU on World Trade Organization terms , which would lead to new tariffs and potentially significant price rises for some goods . A no-deal exit is the nightmare scenario for businesses and investors , who say it would snarl borders , spook financial markets and sow chaos through supply chains that stretch across Europe and beyond .", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 6, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London"}, {"start": 9, "end": 17, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels"}, {"start": 20, "end": 27, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 32, "end": 39, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 55, "end": 68, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson"}, {"start": 83, "end": 102, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission"}, {"start": 113, "end": 133, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_von_der_Leyen"}, {"start": 240, "end": 246, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit"}, {"start": 277, "end": 284, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 294, "end": 308, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"start": 532, "end": 539, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson"}, {"start": 544, "end": 557, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_von_der_Leyen"}, {"start": 801, "end": 807, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit"}, {"start": 841, "end": 848, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 853, "end": 859, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"}, {"start": 903, "end": 911, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19"}, {"start": 923, "end": 930, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 1240, "end": 1254, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Barnier"}, {"start": 1276, "end": 1282, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London"}, {"start": 1298, "end": 1306, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels"}, {"start": 1309, "end": 1316, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson"}, {"start": 1342, "end": 1349, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Barnier"}, {"start": 1353, "end": 1355, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 1368, "end": 1379, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Frost"}, {"start": 1435, "end": 1442, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_von_der_Leyen"}, {"start": 1443, "end": 1448, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_der_Leyen_Commission"}, {"start": 1707, "end": 1713, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"start": 1745, "end": 1752, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 1814, "end": 1820, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"start": 1831, "end": 1846, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron"}, {"start": 1952, "end": 1959, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Barnier"}, {"start": 2046, "end": 2052, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Macron"}, {"start": 2077, "end": 2084, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 2138, "end": 2160, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum"}, {"start": 2222, "end": 2229, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 2319, "end": 2326, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson"}, {"start": 2553, "end": 2560, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 2579, "end": 2587, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"}, {"start": 2632, "end": 2646, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 2674, "end": 2698, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"}, {"start": 2981, "end": 2987, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe"}]}, {"text": "U.N. evacuates staff from Central African Republic.

Flavio Cotti, the chairman of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), told German radio the Vienna-based body viewed the conflict in Chechnya as an internal Russian problem. \"The OSCE is completely involved.

Russian peacemaker Alexander Lebed and Chechen separatist military leader Aslan Maskhadov started a new round of peace talks on Friday just outside the rebel region. Cotti said Chechnya must remain part of Russia, but the solution to the conflict would be to accord the region maximum autonomy within Russia's borders. \"There is no doubt that Chechnya, according to OSCE principles, belongs to a state called Russia,\" he said, pointing out that Russia was an OSCE member and it was not the organisation's policy to challenge members ' sovereignty. He added that the OSCE was the only international body which has been allowed into the Chechnya to monitor the human rights situation there, but that its means were restricted by the fact that the conflict was a \"internal issue\". \"We have a small concept, the details of which have yet to be worked out.

Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco said in a videotaped message his office \u201c will not be blackmailed \u201d into enforcing the governor \u2019s orders , and Orange County Sheriff Don Barnes said in a statement his deputies would not respond to calls to enforce violations of the mask mandate , stay-at-home orders or the ban on social gatherings . But the mayor of one Los Angeles County town said more enforcement was needed . \u201c People absolutely should be arrested for not wearing masks , \u201d Lancaster Mayor R. Rex Perris told the Orange County Register . \u201c Most of these people have never been arrested before . Spend one night incarcerated , and they wo n\u2019t do it again . \u201d California reported more than 30,000 new cases on Sunday , exceeding the state \u2019s previous high of 21,986 set on Dec. 4 , and marked a new record for hospitalized COVID-19 patients . New Jersey , North Carolina , Virginia and West Virginia also announced record one-day rises in new infections . Nationwide , COVID-19 infections in United States are at their peak with an average of 193,863 new cases reported each day over the past week , according to a Reuters tally of official data . There have been 14.7 million infections and 282,253 coronavirus-related deaths reported in the country since the pandemic began . Dr. Anthony Fauci , who has been tapped by President-elect Joe Biden to be his chief medical adviser on coronavirus , on Monday warned the surge could get worse after the year-end holiday season . After millions ignored expert advice and traveled for the Thanksgiving holiday in November , Fauci anticipated Americans would once again behave recklessly during Christmas and New Year \u2019s Eve festivities . \u201c Nobody wants to modify , if not essentially shut down , their holiday season , but we live in a very critical time in this country right now , \u201d Fauci said in an interview with CNN . Biden , a Democrat , has said he will make the pandemic his top priority upon taking office on Jan. 20 . Departing President Donald Trump , a Republican , has downplayed public health measures such as mask-wearing , instead banking on the rapid development of vaccines , which could receive federal approval as soon as next week . Anticipating that approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , the White House will host a vaccine distribution summit on Tuesday with governors , retail pharmacy chains and shipping companies , Health Secretary Alex Azar told Fox News . The aim of the meeting was \u201c to be very transparent and show the world how comprehensively we have planned out every aspect of this distribution , \u201d Azar said .", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 11, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles"}, {"start": 14, "end": 21, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 26, "end": 36, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"}, {"start": 166, "end": 179, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 260, "end": 268, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19"}, {"start": 358, "end": 367, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japantown,_San_Francisco"}, {"start": 467, "end": 475, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19"}, {"start": 481, "end": 494, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco"}, {"start": 497, "end": 507, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"}, {"start": 510, "end": 514, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 537, "end": 544, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 568, "end": 580, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom"}, {"start": 731, "end": 750, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California"}, {"start": 784, "end": 803, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_California"}, {"start": 820, "end": 842, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area"}, {"start": 942, "end": 952, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"}, {"start": 1261, "end": 1267, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1291, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"}, {"start": 1400, "end": 1411, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Police_Department"}, {"start": 1414, "end": 1420, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California"}, {"start": 1425, "end": 1434, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverside_County,_California"}, {"start": 1548, "end": 1564, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverside_County_Sheriff%27s_Department"}, {"start": 1697, "end": 1710, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County_Sheriff%27s_Department_(California)"}, {"start": 1909, "end": 1927, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California"}, {"start": 2033, "end": 2042, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancaster,_California"}, {"start": 2072, "end": 2094, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Orange_County_Register"}, {"start": 2217, "end": 2227, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"}, {"start": 2380, "end": 2388, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States"}, {"start": 2400, "end": 2410, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey"}, {"start": 2413, "end": 2427, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina"}, {"start": 2430, "end": 2438, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia"}, {"start": 2443, "end": 2456, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia"}, {"start": 2549, "end": 2562, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 2672, "end": 2679, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 2839, "end": 2852, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Fauci"}, {"start": 2894, "end": 2903, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden"}, {"start": 3090, "end": 3102, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(United_States)"}, {"start": 3125, "end": 3130, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Fauci"}, {"start": 3143, "end": 3152, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 3195, "end": 3204, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas"}, {"start": 3386, "end": 3391, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Fauci"}, {"start": 3418, "end": 3421, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN"}, {"start": 3424, "end": 3429, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden"}, {"start": 3434, "end": 3442, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)"}, {"start": 3549, "end": 3561, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"start": 3566, "end": 3576, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)"}, {"start": 3831, "end": 3842, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"start": 3976, "end": 3985, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Azar"}, {"start": 3991, "end": 3999, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News"}, {"start": 4151, "end": 4155, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Azar"}]}, {"text": "Ex-minister, son killed in Central Africa unrest. Raphael Kopessoua BANGUI 1996-12-06 A former cabinet minister in Central African Republic and his son were abducted from their home and murdered in growing ethnic violence in the capital Bangui, a government minister said on Friday. With violence spiralling out of control, France voiced backing for the elected Bangui government but said its troops based in the former colony under defence pacts would not help it combat army mutineers. \"France cannot be involved in the domestic political debate,\" President Jacques Chirac told a news conference at the end of a Franco-African summit in Burkina Faso. \"French troops may only take part in maintaining order to avoid major abuses and protect foreign communities,\" he said. Public Service Minister David Dofara, who is the head of the national Red Cross, told Reuters he had seen the bodies of former interior minister Christophe Grelombe and his son, who was not named. Witnesses said they had been seized by troops loyal to President Ange-Felix Patasse at dawn on Thursday when they clashed with soldiers staging a mutiny since November 16. Grelombe is from the Yakoma tribe to which most of the rebel soldiers belong. The uprising began over pay demands but has turned into a campaign to topple Patasse, sparking ethnic violence and dividing the capital. The former minister and his son had been taken from their home close to the presidential palace, which is guarded by loyalist soldiers backed by French troops based in Bangui. The bodies were found on Thursday in an open field about two km (one mile) further away, said Dofora and other witnesses. The men were seized as loyalist forces and French troops fought gunbattles with mutineers who fired rockets into the city centre. A French-owned hotel was slightly damaged. Yakomas are hounded in stronghold districts of Patasse's Baya people while other tribes have fled areas in rebel hands. Roadblocks have been erected in city districts while central Bangui, which is patrolled by French troops with tanks, is deserted. Shops and businesses have remained shut this week. The Franco-African summit decided to send a mission Bangui to seek ways of containing the mutiny and a threat of civil war. Chirac said Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore would visit Bangui \"in the coming hours\" with the heads of state of Gabon, Mali and Chad to try and establish dialogue between authorities and rebels. The mutiny forced Patasse to miss the summit. His spokesman had predicted the meeting to send an assessment mission. Patasse, who won Central Africa's first multi-party elections, refuses to resign. Church-led meadiation attempts hit deadlock over rebel demands for his departure. Soldiers staged mutinies in April and May, with French troops stepping in with tanks and helicopters to quell the more serious second uprising. Patasse offered concessions and amnesty to rebels before the May rebellion ended after rebels looted the city centre. Rebels accuse Patasse of tribalism and of arming his civilian supporters and hired guns from Sudan and Chad. Mutineers have vowed to disarm all civilians and to chase out the foreign forces knwon as Codos. Hospital sources and witnesses said about 10 people were known to have been killed in the more than two weeks of fighting, including two rebels killed in Thursday's clashes. An undetermined number of people are reported to have been abducted and killed outside the town by tribal vigilante groups. In Thursday's fighting, French troops fired back as mutineers trying to break out of their strongholds rained mortar shells on the city centre.", "value": [{"start": 27, "end": 41, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_African_Republic"}, {"start": 68, "end": 74, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangui"}, {"start": 115, "end": 139, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_African_Republic"}, {"start": 237, "end": 243, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangui"}, {"start": 324, "end": 330, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"start": 362, "end": 368, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangui"}, {"start": 489, "end": 495, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"start": 560, "end": 574, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Chirac"}, {"start": 639, "end": 651, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkina_Faso"}, {"start": 654, "end": 660, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"start": 843, "end": 852, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Committee_of_the_Red_Cross"}, {"start": 859, "end": 866, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 1035, "end": 1053, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ange-F\u00e9lix_Patass\u00e9"}, {"start": 1163, "end": 1169, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakoma_people"}, {"start": 1502, "end": 1508, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"start": 1525, "end": 1531, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangui"}, {"start": 1698, "end": 1704, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"start": 1828, "end": 1835, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakoma_people"}, {"start": 2009, "end": 2015, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangui"}, {"start": 2039, "end": 2045, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"start": 2181, "end": 2187, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangui"}, {"start": 2265, "end": 2277, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkina_Faso"}, {"start": 2288, "end": 2303, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Compaor\u00e9"}, {"start": 2316, "end": 2322, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangui"}, {"start": 2372, "end": 2377, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabon"}, {"start": 2379, "end": 2383, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali"}, {"start": 2388, "end": 2392, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad"}, {"start": 2784, "end": 2790, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"start": 3091, "end": 3096, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan"}, {"start": 3101, "end": 3105, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad"}, {"start": 3197, "end": 3202, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codos"}, {"start": 3526, "end": 3532, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}]}, {"text": "Dutch say no reason to reopen El Al carqo enquiry.

The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Azerbaijani presidential adviser Vafa Gulizade and his Armenian counterpart Zhirayr Liparityan met to discuss the disputed enclave on Wednesday and had now flown home. An uneasy ceasefire has prevailed in Nagorno-Karabakh, which represents around 20 percent of Azeri territory, since May 1994 after ethnic Armenians drove Azeris out of the region. The conflict, which began in 1988, claimed over 10,000 lives. \"The main subject (of the talks) was the search for a peaceful solution for Nagorno-Karabakh,\" the source said. He declined to reveal any more details about the content of the talks or their exact location in Germany. Azerbaijan has said it is prepared to grant autonomy to Nagorno-Karabakh if Armenian forces pull out, but will not accept Armenia's demands for the independence of the enclave. Russia's Interfax news agency reported on Tuesday the officials had departed for negotiations in Germany, adding that face-to-face talks between the two sides first took place last December in Amsterdam.

The increased offer , which values Countrywide at 325 pence per share or 164.4 million pounds , is 30 % higher than the previous proposal of 250 pence per share , spurring a near 19 % jump in share price in morning trade . \u201c Countrywide desperately needs a deliverable solution to its current financial problems and lack of strategic direction , \u201d Connells Chief Executive Officer David Livesey said . Countrywide \u2019s share price has more than doubled in value since the news of Connells \u2019 approach in November . Countrywide said it would evaluate the Connells offer in consultation with its major shareholders along with \u201c all other available options \u201d including the revised proposal from Alchemy and a capital raise from existing shareholders . That followed an announcement in Countrywide last month naming former William Hill chief Philip Bowcock as its new CEO to lead talks on a new rescue deal , after shareholders rejected the initial offer from Alchemy . Alchemy said on Monday it was considering options regarding its proposal for Countrywide and urged its shareholders to take no action in relation to the Connells offer . Alchemy \u2019s earlier offer included an option for existing investors to sell their Countrywide shares at 250 pence per share to be fully funded by Alchemy and a 70-million-pound recapitalisation plan . In addition to its earlier woes , Countrywide was hit hard this year by the COVID-19 pandemic which initially battered property sales .

Rolf Soderlind LONGYEAR, Norway 1996-08-30 The windblown, chilly streets of this tiny Arctic town are all but deserted and flags are flying at half-mast beneath a brooding, clouded sky. Longyear is a town in mourning, a close-knit community that has been shattered. Disaster struck on Thursday when a Russian airliner bringing coal miners to work crashed as it came in to land at the airport, killing all 141 people on board. \"It's a sight I will never forget. I will remember it for the rest of my life,\" said Stig Onarheim. He was one of a handful of rescuers who raced to the scene of the crash in a helicopter on Thursday, hoping in vain to find survivors. The plane smashed into a snow-capped mountain on the Arctic island of Spitzbergen on Thursday, just east of Longyear. \"Imagine a big plane with a lot of luggage and people on board. Think of all that mixed together, with twisted, wrecked parts on the slope,\" Onarheim, 29, told Reuters. Police and local officials have sealed off the crash site, protecting it from intrusive reporters and from the polar bears that roam freely across the icy expanses. The dead were all Russians and Ukrainians, coming to work in the mining towns of Barentsburg and Pyramiden. Longyear is a Norwegian settlement of just over 1,000 people, but it also feels the loss keenly. \"I have trouble finding the words to express my grief. It's a tragedy for everyone. We know many of the people who live in Barentsburg, some of them could have been on the plane,\" said Johan Sletten, 52. Sletten, a caretaker who has lived on the island for 30 years, said the Norwegian and Russian communities visit frequently, competing at soccer in the summer and with snow-scooter races in the winter. Teenage shop assistant Heidi Groenstein was blunter. \"I'm glad it was not a Norwegian plane,\" she said. \"Just think of it-- a mining village where so many workers die. They must be having a tough time of it now.\" Barentsburg, just a few hours ride by snow-scooter or 15 minutes by helicopter from Longyear, has asked to be left alone with its grief and told reporters to stay away. Around 100 Russian and Ukrainian miners were waiting in Longyear to fly home on the plane that crashed. They were given shelter in the town's church overnight and ate a sombre breakfast before getting on a bus for the airport. Another plane had been sent from Moscow to pick them up. At this time of year, the only colour in Longyear comes from the brightly-painted wooden houses. Everything else is muddy, the waters of the fjord leaden. Winter is in the air. Barentsburg is an even grimmer place, a run-down testament to the hardships of the new Russia. Spitzbergen lies some 500 miles (800 km) off the northern tip of Norway and endures one of the most extreme climates on the planet. Inhabited by fewer than 3,000 people in total, it sees the sun for 24 hours a day during summer and is plunged into round-the-clock darkness in the winter months. The terrain is mountainous, the only roads are dirt tracks. Norway rules the island group under the terms of a 1920s international treaty which gave many other nations the right to establish setttlements and exploit the coal that is still mined there. Only Russia has chosen to do so.", "value": [{"start": 15, "end": 21, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic"}, {"start": 63, "end": 71, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longyearbyen"}, {"start": 73, "end": 79, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"}, {"start": 134, "end": 140, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic"}, {"start": 349, "end": 356, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}, {"start": 762, "end": 768, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic"}, {"start": 987, "end": 994, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 1179, "end": 1187, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}, {"start": 1192, "end": 1202, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine"}, {"start": 1242, "end": 1253, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barentsburg"}, {"start": 1258, "end": 1267, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramiden"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1292, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"}, {"start": 1489, "end": 1500, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barentsburg"}, {"start": 1642, "end": 1651, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"}, {"start": 1656, "end": 1663, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}, {"start": 1847, "end": 1856, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"}, {"start": 1984, "end": 1995, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barentsburg"}, {"start": 2068, "end": 2076, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longyearbyen"}, {"start": 2164, "end": 2171, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}, {"start": 2176, "end": 2185, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine"}, {"start": 2413, "end": 2419, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow"}, {"start": 2614, "end": 2625, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barentsburg"}, {"start": 2701, "end": 2707, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}, {"start": 2774, "end": 2780, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"}, {"start": 3064, "end": 3070, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"}, {"start": 3261, "end": 3267, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}]}, {"text": "Skinheads attack Bratislava Rabbi - police.

Wildfires in the United States meant supply was always going to be tight this year . Unpredictable shipments due to global lockdown restrictions are exacerbating the situation . Although air freight into Hong Kong has improved , declining just 5 % year-on-year in October compared to April \u2019s 13 % drop , a surge in transport costs has made it harder for smaller vendors to keep stock . Hong Kongers will have to deck the halls with something else . ( By Robyn Mak ) GLOOMY GOOSE . Remo Ruffini has finally taken an initial step on the way to creating Italy \u2019s answer to Bernard Arnault \u2019s LVMH . The boss of 11 billion euro puffer-jacket maker Moncler on Monday announced the takeover of Stone Island , an Italian casualwear brand . The deal values the target at 1.15 billion euros , or 16.6 times 2020 EBITDA , compared to Moncler \u2019s 22.7 times on the same metric . Ruffini has been able to use his premium valuation to pay partly in shares , by issuing new equity to the family which owns Stone Island . With ski resorts facing a slump due to the pandemic , Moncler \u2019s puffer jacket cash cow may take a hit . And given Stone Island made an operating profit of 61 million euros in 2020 , Ruffini also looks on Breakingviews calculations to be facing a sub-5 % return on his investment . Still , diversifying via a streetwear brand might help . Stone Island has a strong digital presence with up to 25 % of sales in 2019 via e-commerce , against 8 % for the overall luxury market . Moncler is still way off LVMH \u2019s 248 billion euro heft , but at least it \u2019s making headway . ( By Karen Kwok ) OFFICE BET . Buyout group EQT is hedging the work-from-home risk . The Swedish group said on Sunday it had agreed to sell facilities management provider Apleona to French private equity rival PAI Partners for 1.6 billion euros . After earnings before interest , tax and amortisation growth of more than 10 % a year , workplace facility management may be hampered by the pandemic-inspired trend to work from home . Roughly 30 % of the business relates to office facility management . EQT sold Apleona for just 200 million euros more than what it paid for it in 2016 , but smaller divestments have topped up returns . Having sold Apleona \u2019s low-margin construction arm in 2017 and a UK real estate business in 2018 , the gross return works out at around 2.5 times invested capital . Avoiding a bet on what will happen to demand for offices is another upside . PAI will have to hope at least some value remains on the table .

Lynnley Browning MOSCOW 1996-12-06 Russian Finance Minister Alexander Livshits warned financially-troubled Norilsk Nickel on Friday that it must pay overdue taxes, but analysts said the firm would not be liquidated or that its would assets would be frozen. \"Norilsk really is a big debtor, both to the federal and regional budgets,\" said Konstantin Chernyshev, equities analyst at Moscow brokerage Rinaco Plus and a Norilsk watcher. \"Livshits's words are an attempt to put pressure on the company.\" The official Itar-Tass news agency quoted Livshits as telling parliamentary deputies that RAO Norilsky Nikel 0#NKEL.RUO had to pay its tax arrears and that bankruptcy procedures applied to the metals group. \"If it was an unsolicited statement and a bolt out of the blue, then it obviously means something,\" said Christopher Granville, chief economist at United City Bank in Moscow. \"But if it was a response to a deputy's question that was essentially loaded, then it was the only answer he could have given.\" Russian tax and cabinet authorities, under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to boost tax revenues as a condition for receiving payments of a $ 10 billion, three-year loan to Moscow, have been striking fear into the hearts of some of Russia's most prominent industrial firms by saying they must pay up or face liquidation. \"They could freeze metal, but it's not a long-term solution to the problem and would n't put money in the budget,\" Chernyshev said. \"I do n't think they would do that.\" Entire social infrastructures in the icy Far North where Norilsk is based depend on the company, and Moscow has said it has no finances to resettle hundreds of thousands of people-- an expenditure which could far outstrip Norilsk's debts. Norilsk officials declined to comment. Analysts said the government, while anxious about Norilsk's debts, is highly unlikely to bring the nickel, copper, cobalt, platinum and platinum group metals producer to its knees or take measures that could significantly affect output. But it also wants Norilsk, the world's second-largest nickel producer, to clean up its act. \"The procedure of bankruptcy will be applied,\" Tass quoted Livshits as telling Duma deputies about Norilsk. It indirectly quoted him as saying Norilsk should first pay salary arrears, which in the past have led to worker strikes. \"It is unlikely that Norilsk will pay these debts in the near-term-- the company will remain a debtor in the near future,\" Chernyshev said. He estimated the company's regional debts at least one trillion roubles and said 30 percent of the giant Krasnoyarsk regional budget was fuelled by Norilsk money. Norilsk's new majority shareholder, Russian commerical bank Uneximbank, has said it is reorganising metal exports through Interrosimpex in order to boost revenues. But the changes have yet to improve significantly Norilsk's situation. \"Uneximbank has inherited a mountain and whether or not they climb out and over it remains to be seen,\" said one metals source. Norilsk said in September that it total debts, including unpaid salaries to workers, were 13 trillion roubles. The company said last month that it had worked out a tax payment schedule with authorities, after regional tax officials threatened to seize some nickel and copper assets.-- Moscow Newsroom,+7095 941 8520", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 6, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}, {"start": 13, "end": 20, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norilsk"}, {"start": 69, "end": 75, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow"}, {"start": 87, "end": 94, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}, {"start": 159, "end": 173, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMC_Norilsk_Nickel"}, {"start": 310, "end": 317, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norilsk"}, {"start": 433, "end": 439, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow"}, {"start": 468, "end": 475, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norilsk"}, {"start": 564, "end": 573, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Telegraph_Agency_of_Russia"}, {"start": 925, "end": 931, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow"}, {"start": 1061, "end": 1068, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}, {"start": 1122, "end": 1149, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund"}, {"start": 1248, "end": 1254, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow"}, {"start": 1307, "end": 1313, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}, {"start": 1622, "end": 1629, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norilsk"}, {"start": 1666, "end": 1672, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow"}, {"start": 1787, "end": 1794, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norilsk"}, {"start": 1804, "end": 1811, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norilsk"}, {"start": 1893, "end": 1900, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norilsk"}, {"start": 2098, "end": 2105, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norilsk"}, {"start": 2219, "end": 2223, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Telegraph_Agency_of_Russia"}, {"start": 2251, "end": 2255, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duma"}, {"start": 2271, "end": 2278, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norilsk"}, {"start": 2315, "end": 2322, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norilsk"}, {"start": 2423, "end": 2430, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norilsk"}, {"start": 2647, "end": 2658, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krasnoyarsk"}, {"start": 2690, "end": 2697, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norilsk"}, {"start": 2705, "end": 2712, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norilsk"}, {"start": 2741, "end": 2748, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}, {"start": 2919, "end": 2926, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norilsk"}, {"start": 3068, "end": 3075, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norilsk"}]}, {"text": "TOKYO ( Reuters ) - The emergence of Japan \u2019s coldest city as a COVID-19 hotspot has raised fears among health experts that it could be a sign of what the rest of the nation may face as winter sets in and more people stay indoors , raising airborne transmission risks .

REUTERS / Issei Kato The city of Asahikawa , about 140 km ( 87 miles ) north of Sapporo on the northern island of Hokkaido , is reeling from infection clusters at two hospitals and a care home . By Sunday , the number of cases recorded on the island was more than 10,000 , and Asahikawa had accounted for 16 % of the 256 deaths . It prompted the government to announce a plan on Monday to send nurses from Self Defense Forces to the region and western metropolis of Osaka to help fight the outbreak . \u201c Hokkaido is a place where due to the climate conditions people tend to have the heater on very high and in very closed spaces as well , \u201d said Haruo Ozaki , president of the Tokyo Medical Association . \u201c In places such as Tokyo and Osaka , it will also be getting colder from now . When we add this coldness factor , it shows that we need to express a lot more caution or we could face a further spread of contagion . \u201d Asahikawa , a city of 340,000 people , holds the record for Japan \u2019s lowest recorded temperature of - 41C ( - 41.8F ) in 1902 . Researchers have warned that airborne transmission of the virus increase when people spend more time in closed-up rooms breathing dry air . \u201c Asahikawa and including Sapporo are in a various serious condition in terms of the pandemic , \u201d said Dr. Yasutaka Kakinoki at Asahikawa City hospital . The burgeoning caseload has brought the health system in Asahikawa to \u201c near collapse \u201d , he said . Asahikawa Kosei Hospital has been the site of 224 infections of patients and staff , prompting the facility to turn away all but the most critical cases . Yoshida Hospital , a private facility in the city , has 184 cases and has had difficulty transferring patients to other hospitals . \u201c It \u2019s a difficult situation we are facing , \u201d Asahikawa mayor Masahito Nishikawa said in a recent online briefing , asking citizens to avoid the city \u2019s major hospitals .

Hokkaido was first to declare a state of emergency earlier this year amid the first wave of the pandemic and it was also largely spared a second wave that struck Tokyo and the large population centres in the summer . While winter cold and dry air have been factors in Hokkaido \u2019s COVID-19 clusters , a lack of aggressive testing and containment have also exacerbated the outbreaks in Asahikawa , Shibuya said . Others caution against predicting the contagion pattern seen in Hokkaido could be repeated elsewhere in the country .

The appointment boosts the number of military figures in key roles , something that has dismayed some political factions . After the ouster of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita on Aug. 18 , hopes of a civilian-led transition were dashed by the appointment of the junta \u2019s leader as vice president , while retired colonel Bah Ndaw became president . At its inaugural meeting , a transitional council of 121 members has now approved as its president Colonel Malick Diaw , one of the coup \u2019s organisers . His nomination was backed by 111 members , said a spokesman for the group that led the junta - the National Committee for the Salvation of the People ( CNSP ) . The council will be responsible for voting on reforms and legislative changes during an 18-month transitional period before elections are held .

LA CORUNA, Spain 1996-08-31 A late goal by newly-signed defender Roberto Carlos saved the blushes of Real Madrid coach Fabio Capello and his multi-billion peseta line-up in the opening game of the Spanish championship on Saturday. The Brazilian's 79th-minute effort was enough to earn Real a point from a scrappy 1-1 draw at fellow title contenders Deportivo Coruna. Deportivo started strongly, taking the lead midway through the first half when former Auxerre playmaker Corentine Martins headed home a corner after a flick-on by Brazilian-born Spanish international midfielder Donato. Real looked to be in deep trouble shortly after the break when Luis Milla was sent off for committing two bookable offences in as many minutes. But Deportivo were unable to capitalise on their numerical advantage, and were themselves reduced to ten men when Armando Alvarez was sent off 15 minutes from time. Shortly afterwards Roberto Carlos found space in the home defence and equalised for Real with a shot that was deflected past despairing Deportivo ' keeper Jacques Songo'o. In a frantic final five minutes there were chances at both ends, and Donato, who had earlier been booked, was sent off for protesting about the incursion of Real players at a free kick. Before the match Deportivo chairman Augusto Lendoiro said he would ignore a FIFA decision banning Brazilian midfielder Mauro Silva from playing in the match for failing to join his national side's tour of Europe.

MEXICO CITY Mexican stocks closed sharply lower Friday, but had made a tentative recovery as initial panic and volatility abated. \"It was Greenspan at first. Then once we saw the Dow (Jones industrial average) was not about to crash, some buyers stepped in,\" said a trader, referring to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, whose comments that assets were \"irrationally exhuberant\" upset financial markets worldwide. The blue-chip IPC index ended down 1.29 points, or 43.56 percent, at 3,333.05. Volume was regular at 74.7 million shares traded. Mexican stocks were also hurt by U.S. long bond rates which had begun to rise before Greenspan's comments and were inflated by employment data released before trade began in Mexico. Yields on U.S. 30-year Treasury bonds were 6.51 percent when stock trading closed in Mexico, unchanged from Thursday. On the broad market, 107 stocks changed hands, of which losers well outnumbered winners by 75 to 13. Traders noted the lack of blue chips or stocks traded at significant volume among the gainers. Simec, the steelmaking arm of the debt-ridden Sidek group headed the losers, off 7 centavos (1 cent) at 1.40 pesos (18 cents). Sidek fell 4 centavos (1 cent) to 95 centavos (12 cents). Traders also remarked that Mexican ADRs suffered in New York. Heavyweights Telmex and Televisa ended off 25 cents and 75 cents, respectively, at $ 31.125 and $ 25.875. \"Falling share prices in New York do n't hurt Mexico as long as it happens gradually, as earlier this week. It's a sudden plunge that takes its toll,\" said Carlos Ponce, research director at Santander. Traders and analysts differed as to how firm the relative recovery on Friday was. \"Some buyers stepped in, but the market was not very convinced. Volume was lackluster,\" said one trader. \"The market's very healthy, we're buying,\" said another trader. Ponce said shares were certainly attractively priced in Mexico, but would not appreciate until foreign buyers stepped in, which they had yet to do.

Simona de Logu RIO DE JANEIRO 1996-12-06 Plastic surgery is booming, especially among men, as Brazilians spend much of their new-found wealth on the latest beauty treatments, said the organisers of a four-day international plastic surgery conference that opened on Friday. The number of plastic surgeries in Brazil has jumped 30 percent to an estimated 150,000 this year since an anti-inflation plan was introduced in July 1994, Farid Hakme, the president of the Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society (SBCP), said. The number of operations on men increased even more-- by 80 percent, from 8,000 in 1994 to 15,000 in 1995, he said. \"Brazil ranks right at the top for plastic surgery with respect to the number of surgeons, the number of patients, number of operations, number of conferences. Our statistics are the highest for everything,\" Hakme said. \"We believe the increase in plastic surgeries for men results from the difficulties in the job market. People need to have a more youthful look to compete in the job market, given the profound changes in Latin America's economy.\" A controlled exchange rate, trade liberalisation and tight monetary policies have also dramatically curbed inflation, making more money available for cosmetic surgery. Brazil has been at the forefront in plastic surgery for decades and is home to one of the most famous surgeons, Ivo Pitangy. There are 6,000 plastic surgeons there, of which 4,500 have qualified to be members of the SBCP. Every year, 500 new plastic surgeons graduate in Brazil and medical students from all over the world come to study there. Hakme attributes Brazil's fascination with plastic surgery not to excessive vanity but to the country's mix and match of different races, which can create physical disharmonies. \"What happens is the nose sometimes does n't match the mouth or the buttocks do n't match with the legs,\" he said. Brazil's most sought-after beauty treatment is liposuction in which fat is sucked away from areas of the body, with about 30,000 operations a year at a cost of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 each. Stomach tucks and breast operations are also popular since the tropical climate calls for flesh-baring fashions, but unlike women elsewhere Brazilians tend to have breast reductions and buttock implants. \"The women who want to reduce their breasts here would probably want to increase them in the United States,\" SBCP Vice-President Oswaldo Saldanha said. \"Beauty ideals and cultures are different in every country.\" Plastic surgery scares like the case in which Brazilian model Claudia Liz fell into a coma after being anaesthetised for a liposuction in October are not much of a deterrent. Saldanha said operations fell 30 percent immediately after that case but the rate was back to normal now.", "value": [{"start": 30, "end": 36, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"}, {"start": 53, "end": 67, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro"}, {"start": 132, "end": 142, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"}, {"start": 346, "end": 352, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"}, {"start": 666, "end": 672, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"}, {"start": 1089, "end": 1102, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America"}, {"start": 1283, "end": 1289, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"}, {"start": 1554, "end": 1560, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"}, {"start": 1644, "end": 1650, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"}, {"start": 1920, "end": 1926, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"}, {"start": 1967, "end": 1978, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposuction"}, {"start": 2245, "end": 2255, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"}, {"start": 2402, "end": 2415, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 2568, "end": 2577, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"}]}, {"text": "BEIJING , Dec 7 ( Reuters ) - China \u2019s soybean imports in November jumped from the previous year , customs data showed on Monday , as cargoes booked from the U.S. following the Phase 1 trade deal cleared customs .

Ramos Horta has been a vocal leader of the opposition to Jakarta's rule in the territory. Belo and Ramos Horta were awared the prize for their efforts to secure a peaceful solution to the issue of East Timor, a former Portuguese colony which Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year. The United Nations has never recognised Jakarta's move. Alatas said the government's position on the Nobel Peace Prize would have been different if it had been awarded solely to Belo. Asked if the Indonesian ambassador to Norway would have attended the ceremony if only Belo had been involved, Alatas replied : \"Probably, yes, but that is a hypothetical question.\" Alatas said on Tuesday that on his way back from Oslo, Belo would visit the Vatican to see the Pope, and would also meet German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn. Kohl had wanted to meet Belo during the chancellor's official visit to Indonesia last month, but the bishop was too busy in East Timor to come to Jakarta.", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 9, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia"}, {"start": 12, "end": 16, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Filipe_Ximenes_Belo"}, {"start": 28, "end": 33, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize"}, {"start": 50, "end": 54, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dili"}, {"start": 56, "end": 66, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor"}, {"start": 92, "end": 106, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church"}, {"start": 114, "end": 125, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Filipe_Ximenes_Belo"}, {"start": 131, "end": 135, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dili"}, {"start": 160, "end": 166, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"}, {"start": 219, "end": 236, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize"}, {"start": 253, "end": 257, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Filipe_Ximenes_Belo"}, {"start": 285, "end": 295, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia"}, {"start": 304, "end": 311, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta"}, {"start": 399, "end": 403, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo"}, {"start": 441, "end": 446, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize"}, {"start": 499, "end": 515, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Ramos-Horta"}, {"start": 544, "end": 553, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia"}, {"start": 559, "end": 569, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia"}, {"start": 612, "end": 623, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Ramos-Horta"}, {"start": 659, "end": 669, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Alatas"}, {"start": 690, "end": 699, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia"}, {"start": 759, "end": 768, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"}, {"start": 883, "end": 894, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Ramos-Horta"}, {"start": 952, "end": 962, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor"}, {"start": 966, "end": 972, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Alatas"}, {"start": 1098, "end": 1136, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organisation_of_the_Islamic_Conference"}, {"start": 1146, "end": 1153, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta"}, {"start": 1155, "end": 1166, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Ramos-Horta"}, {"start": 1212, "end": 1219, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta"}, {"start": 1254, "end": 1265, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Ramos-Horta"}, {"start": 1352, "end": 1362, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor"}, {"start": 1373, "end": 1383, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal"}, {"start": 1397, "end": 1406, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia"}, {"start": 1459, "end": 1473, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations"}, {"start": 1495, "end": 1502, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta"}, {"start": 1556, "end": 1573, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize"}, {"start": 1652, "end": 1662, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia"}, {"start": 1677, "end": 1683, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway"}, {"start": 1869, "end": 1873, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo"}, {"start": 1896, "end": 1903, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vatican_City"}, {"start": 1915, "end": 1919, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope"}, {"start": 1941, "end": 1947, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"}, {"start": 1959, "end": 1970, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Kohl"}, {"start": 1974, "end": 1978, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonn"}, {"start": 1980, "end": 1984, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Kohl"}, {"start": 2051, "end": 2060, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia"}, {"start": 2104, "end": 2114, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor"}, {"start": 2126, "end": 2133, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta"}]}, {"text": "ANKARA ( Reuters ) - Turkey has entered its first full weekend lockdown since May after coronavirus infections and deaths hit record highs in recent days .

Vithoon Amorn RANGOON 1996-12-06 About 200 Burmese students marched briefly from troubled Yangon Institute of Technology in northern Rangoon on Friday towards the University of Yangon six km (four miles) away, and returned to their campus, witnesses said. Seven truckloads of armed riot police and three fire engines were on standby at one of the junctions near the institute. There were no clashes. \"They are now back in the YIT campus,\" an institute official who declined to be identified told Reuters by telephone. One of two roads leading to the University of Yangon from the institute had been closed by authorities. But about 300 university students were still gathered outside the gates of their campus, witnesses said. They were singing peacefully. On Monday and Tuesday, students from the institute and the university launched protests against what they said was unfair handling by police of a brawl between some of their colleagues and restaurant owners in October. On Tuesday and Wednesday, opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was restricted to her home by the military government to prevent her from being drawn into the protests. She was allowed to move freely on Thursday. The protest culminated at dawn on Tuesday with several hundred students being detained briefly by police in central Rangoon. The street protests were the biggest seen in the capital since the student-led pro-democracry demonstrations of September 1988 when the junta crushed the uprising. Thousands were killed or imprisoned. Earlier on Friday some of the students, who were held briefly by police during the protests earlier this week, said they were still dissatisfied with the military government. They told Reuters they were unhappy that the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) had not heeded their calls for the right to organise independent unions on campus. \"We still want government answers to our demands. We want police punishment to be published in newspapers,\" one student said. But the students stressed their protests were non-political and they had no contact with Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD). Suu Kyi, a Nobel laureate and daughter of independence hero Aung San, and key NLD officials have also denied any link with the students. But they have said both parties had a \"moral link\" in that they were against police brutality and injustice. The students also demanded the government announce punishments meted out to policemen who they said had manhandled students involved in a brawl with some restaurant owners near the Yangon institute in October. The students appealed to the government not to close the institute because of their latest demonstration. The institute was shut for nearly two years after the 1988 uprising. On Friday, the road leading to Suu Kyi's lakeside residence in central Rangoon remained closed by police.", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 7, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma"}, {"start": 60, "end": 67, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon"}, {"start": 89, "end": 96, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma"}, {"start": 136, "end": 166, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon_Technological_University"}, {"start": 179, "end": 186, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon"}, {"start": 209, "end": 229, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Yangon"}, {"start": 542, "end": 549, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 596, "end": 616, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Yangon"}, {"start": 1066, "end": 1082, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 1348, "end": 1355, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon"}, {"start": 1743, "end": 1750, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 1785, "end": 1824, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Peace_and_Development_Council"}, {"start": 2131, "end": 2138, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 2141, "end": 2170, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_for_Democracy"}, {"start": 2178, "end": 2185, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 2189, "end": 2194, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize"}, {"start": 2238, "end": 2246, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San"}, {"start": 2605, "end": 2611, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon"}, {"start": 2840, "end": 2847, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 2880, "end": 2887, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon"}]}, {"text": "DUBAI ( Reuters ) - Oman has set up a new state energy company which will own part of the Gulf nation \u2019s largest oil block and be able to raise debt , as the cash-strapped country seeks to offset the impact of lower oil prices . The new company , called Energy Development Oman ( EDO ) , will have a shareholding in Petroleum Development Oman , a state-owned oil and gas exploration and production company , and an interest in Block 6 , according to the country \u2019s Official Gazette . Block 6 is Oman \u2019s largest oil and gas operation , according to energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie . Oman \u2019s energy ministry said EDO is 100 % government-owned and that it will collect oil and gas revenues and pay capital and operating costs . This means Petroleum Development Oman \u2019s oil and gas expenditures will be excluded from the state budget , giving the company financial independence , the energy ministry said in the statement carried by state media . Oman , rated sub-investment grade by all major credit rating agencies , faces a widening deficit and large debt maturities in coming few years . It has recently embarked on a new fiscal plan to wean itself off its dependence on crude revenues . EDO will work on oil and gas exploration as well as on renewable energy projects in Oman , according to the Gazette . It will also \u201c borrow or raise money and / or financing of any nature \u201d and use \u201c defined or identifiable cash flows , revenues , receivables or assets ( including those which are Shariah compliant ) to issue securities in one or more tranches to investors in Oman and / or other countries , \u201d it said . The authorised and issued share capital of the company is 500,000 Omani rials , divided into 500,000 shares , the Gazette added . Low oil prices and the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus outbreak are straining the finances of Oman , a relatively small energy producer .

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06 International trade union leaders on Friday expressed outrage that the head of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) had been barred from speaking at next week's WTO meeting in Singapore. Bill Jordan, general secretary of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), told a news conference the withdrawal of a WTO invitation to ILO director general Michel Hansenne was \"outrageous behaviour on the part of an organisation that wants to command respect in the world\". Jordan said a small group of developing nations that oppose linking trade talks and labour conditions had pressured World Trade Organisation (WTO) officials to prevent Hansenne from taking the platform to urge such links. \"It is to their shame that those who are responsible for encouraging this meeting responded (to the pressure) in silencing him,\" Jordan said after the opening of an ICFTU conference on international labour standards and trade. The three-day trade union conference in Singapore hopes to push labour issues onto the WTO agenda. Jordan said the WTO's credibility was at stake over the issue of trade and labour. The ICFTU said it wanted the WTO conference beginning on Monday to outlaw forced and child labour, end discrimination in hiring, and guarantee the right to join a union. Bill Brett, chairman of the ILO Workers Group, told Reuters before the news conference he was \"not too surprised, but very disappointed\" that the speaking invitation had been withdrawn. \"Some governments are very determined to stop the issue (of trade and labour rights) being discussed,\" he said, adding that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) seemed particularly hostile to the ILO agenda. ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The ILO wants a trade and labour rights \"social clause\" included in the final ministerial statement issued by WTO leaders at the end of the meeting, the organization's first ministerial-level gathering. Speaking to ICFTU delegates, Richard Eglin, director of the WTO secretariat, said the WTO was capable of making a significant contribution to governmental efforts to solve social problems. But he said the WTO's organisational structure made it difficult to impose on its members a social clause such as that called for by the ILO.", "value": [{"start": 38, "end": 41, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Labour_Organization"}, {"start": 48, "end": 57, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 152, "end": 185, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Labour_Organization"}, {"start": 237, "end": 240, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"}, {"start": 252, "end": 261, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 301, "end": 349, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Confederation_of_Free_Trade_Unions"}, {"start": 351, "end": 356, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Confederation_of_Free_Trade_Unions"}, {"start": 402, "end": 405, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"}, {"start": 420, "end": 423, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Labour_Organization"}, {"start": 675, "end": 699, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"}, {"start": 946, "end": 951, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Confederation_of_Free_Trade_Unions"}, {"start": 1048, "end": 1057, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 1095, "end": 1098, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"}, {"start": 1123, "end": 1126, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"}, {"start": 1194, "end": 1199, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Confederation_of_Free_Trade_Unions"}, {"start": 1219, "end": 1222, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"}, {"start": 1412, "end": 1419, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 1674, "end": 1712, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN"}, {"start": 1714, "end": 1719, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN"}, {"start": 1756, "end": 1759, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Labour_Organization"}, {"start": 1781, "end": 1787, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunei"}, {"start": 1789, "end": 1798, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia"}, {"start": 1800, "end": 1808, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia"}, {"start": 1814, "end": 1825, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines"}, {"start": 1827, "end": 1836, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 1838, "end": 1846, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand"}, {"start": 1851, "end": 1858, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam"}, {"start": 1864, "end": 1867, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Labour_Organization"}, {"start": 1970, "end": 1973, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"}, {"start": 2075, "end": 2080, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Confederation_of_Free_Trade_Unions"}, {"start": 2389, "end": 2392, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Labour_Organization"}]}, {"text": "Spencer Rattler threw for 193 yards and two touchdowns as No . 11 Oklahoma beat Baylor 27-14 in Norman , Okla . , on Saturday night .

Instead , the defense played a big role in lifting the Sooners into the Big 12 Championship Game for the fourth consecutive season . Oklahoma \u2019s chances to win a sixth consecutive conference title - or even make the title game - looked dead in early October after starting 0-2 in Big 12 play . The Sooners , however , have reeled off six consecutive wins to clinch a spot in the game , even before the regular-season finale Dec. 12 at West Virginia . That game was originally scheduled for Nov. 28 before COVID-19 issues with the Sooners forced its postponement . Oklahoma ( 7-2 overall , 6-2 Big 12 ) was playing without much of its starting secondary and several other key contributors , especially on defense . But while the Sooners \u2019 offense was largely intact , Baylor \u2019s defense turned in a strong performance . Baylor ( 2-6 , 2-6 ) held the Sooners to their lowest offensive output since early in the 2015 season . But offense was hard to come by for Baylor , too , as the Sooners picked off Charlie Brewer twice and held the Sooners to just 25 yards rushing . Oklahoma sacked Brewer three times , with defensive lineman Isaiah Thomas involved each time , two of them coming solo . Sooners \u2019 running back Rhamondre Stevenson had 98 yards from scrimmage , with 15 carries for 50 yards and a touchdown and five catches for 48 yards . Oklahoma led 3-0 for much of the first half , thanks in part to a pair of missed field goals by Baylor , one from 46 yards and the other from 47 . Stevenson scored the game \u2019s first touchdown , a 3-yard run , with just more than a minute to go before half after the Oklahoma defense forced a punt from just outside the end zone . The Sooners \u2019 offense got the ball at the Baylor 31 . Rattler , who had struggled with Baylor \u2019s pressure throughout the first half , then led a touchdown drive to begin the third quarter to put the Sooners up 17-0 and give them some cushion .

SINGAPORE 1996-12-06 Indian rubber demand is seen outpacing local production in the 1996/97 April / March season and the trend will persist way into the next century, the chairman of the Rubber Board of India said on Friday. K.J. Matthew said at the Asia Rubber Markets meeting here Indian production of natural rubber in 1996/97 will reach 547,000 tonnes against projected demand of 578,000 tonnes, a gap of 31,000 tonnes. For synthetic rubber, production reached 68,200 tonnes in 1995/96 while consumption in the same season hit 134,085 tonnes, Matthew added. \"Though schemes designed to realise further increases in the production of natural rubber are being operated successfully, the demand-supply gap is expected to widen,\" he said. Indian synthetic rubber output is not expected to rise significantly in the next season but demand will rise to 145,000 tonnes. Matthew estimates that by the 2000/01 season, the gap between natural rubber output and consumption will rise to 51,000 tonnes and 319,000 tonnes in 2010/11. Natural rubber production will go up to 695,000 tonnes in 2000/01 against consumption of 746,000 tonnes. In 2010/11, domestic demand should rise further to 1.233 million tonnes while production will only reach about 914,000 tonnes. One way to bridge the widening gap is to put more land under cultivation which the Rubber Board official estimates will reach 220,000 hectares between now and the year 2003 although Matthew said this may not be possible at this time in India. \"The development objective for the rubber plantation industry will be to increase production to the best extent possibly with a view to minimising imports of natural rubber,\" he said.-- Singapore Newsroom (65-8703305)", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 6, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"}, {"start": 51, "end": 60, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 72, "end": 78, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"}, {"start": 334, "end": 340, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"}, {"start": 790, "end": 796, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"}, {"start": 1544, "end": 1549, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India"}]}, {"text": "PARIS ( Reuters ) - Airbus delivered 64 aircraft in November , bringing the total so far this year to 477 , down 34 % from the first 11 months of 2019 as COVID-19 curbs demand , the planemaker said on Monday .

Pettite (19-7) allowed two runs and eight hits over eight innings with a walk and seven strikeouts. He improved to 12-2 following Yankees ' losses. Mariano Rivera pitched a scoreless ninth, striking out two. Ex-Yankee Randy Velarde hit his 11th homer, his most at any professional level. In Seattle, Pete Incaviglia's grand slam with one out in the sixth snapped a tie and lifted the Baltimore Orioles past the Seattle Mariners, 5-2. It was Incaviglia's sixth grand slam and 200th homer of his career. Baltimore's Eddie Murray cracked his 20th homer of the season and 499th of his career. Jay Buhner hit his 38th homer and Edgar Martinez his 23rd for Seattle. The Orioles remained tied with the White Sox for the American League wild card with the Mariners a game back. In Toronto, Kevin Tapani (12-8) allowed two runs and six hits over 7 1/3 innings and Frank Thomas hit his 29th homer and drove in three runs as the Chicago White Sox cruised to an 11-2 victory over the Blue Jays. Thomas, Harold Baines and Robin Ventura each collected three hits. Baines homered and scored three runs. Danny Tartabull added two hits and three RBI as all Chicago starters got at least one hit. In Oakland, Dave Telgheder scattered seven hits over eight innings and Mark McGwire hit his major-league leading 45th homer and drove in three runs as the Athetlics blanked the Boston Red Sox 7-0. Telgheder (2-5) snapped a personal three-game losing streak. Buddy Groom pitched a perfect ninth inning. McGwire singled home a run to spark a three-run sixth and capped the scoring with a two-run homer in the seventh. The loss was Boston's seventh in its last 29 games. In Detroit, Todd Van Poppel pitched a five-hitter for his first career shutout and Tony Clark homered to cap a four-run first inning as the Tigers blanked the Kansas City Royals 4-0. Van Poppel (3-6) walked two and struck out two in defeating the Royals for the second time this week. He threw 108 pitches as he lowered his ERA from 8.08 to 7.24. Kansas City has scored only one run in two games. In Milwaukee, Marc Newfield homered off Jose Parra (5-4) leading off the bottom of the 12th as the Brewers rallied for a 5-4 victory over the Minnesota Twins. Milwaukee has won 10 of its last 15. Bob Wickman (6-1) pitched 2 2/3 hitless innings for the win, his second for the Brewers. Matt Lawton hit a three-run homer off closer Mike Fetters with one out in the ninth to give Minnesota a 4-2 lead. But Milwaukee tied it up in the bottom of the ninth on pinch-hitter Dave Nilsson's two-run double.", "value": [{"start": 11, "end": 19, "tag":

George Nishiyama TOKYO 1996-12-06 Comments by Japan's tight-lipped central bank chief and an influential top bureaucrat are further signs that the nation's authorities want to keep the dollar at current levels, market sources said on Friday. In a rare expression of a view on currencies by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) governor, Yasuo Matsushita was quoted in Japan's leading economic daily on Friday as saying that he sees no further, immediate fall in the yen. This followed a widely watched television appearance late on Thursday by Eisuke Sakakibara, a high-ranking Finance Ministry official, who denied he had said he wants to guide the dollar lower to between 108 and 110 yen. But many in the market thought Sakakibara's real intentions lay elsewhere, and took more notice of his comments about the U.S. government's stance on the dollar, dealers said. \"I think his views on (U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert) Rubin's comments were indeed what he himself thinks about the dollar,\" said Hank Note, chief dealer at Sumitomo Bank. Asked about Rubin's comment that a strong dollar was in U.S. interests, Sakakibara said the remark does not necessarily mean the United States supports a stronger dollar. \"It's a strong dollar, not stronger. In that sense, the comments are not pointing to a certain direction,\" he said. \"It shows that Sakakibara is not for a stronger dollar either,\" said Sumitomo's Note. Takao Sakoh, first vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in Tokyo, said : \"Maybe a dollar at 104.50 yen is not acceptable (to Sakakibara), but it may be okay at the current level, at the lower end of 112 yen.\" Market participants have kept a close eye on Sakakibara, chief of the ministry's International Finance Bureau, as a comment he made in November after the dollar hit this year's high of 114.92 yen pushed the currency down sharply. He had said then that the market's view on Japan's economy was too pessimistic and that he believed it was stronger than the market thought. Dealers have come to refer to 115 yen as the \"Sakakibara ceiling\" for the dollar following the remark. Adding to the comments by \"Mr Yen\", as Sakakibara is known for his prominence in the currency market, was BOJ governor Matsushita's remark. \"The recent level of the yen exchange rate has been stable, and it does not appear to be moving towards a further depreciation of the yen immediately, so import prices are likely to stabilise at current levels,\" Matsushita said in an interview with the Nihon Keizai Shimbun. \"The fact that he touched on the issue of inflation triggered by import prices shows that the BOJ does not want a further depreciation of the yen, past 115 yen,\" said Yasuhito Kawashima, chief forex manager at Toyo Trust & Banking Co. Some said the central bank may have been concerned a weaker yen would lead to unfounded pessimism about Japan's economy. \"There was concern that foreign investors may sell Japanese stocks if the dollar goes above 115 yen. The BOJ does not want the yen's weakness to lead to pessimism over the economy,\" said Taisuke Tanaka, market strategist with Credit Suisse in Tokyo. Senior BOJ officials have separately said financial markets ' views on the economy have been too negative. \"I realise there are negative views in the markets about the impact of the consumption tax hike and drop in public spending, but the markets appear to be exaggerating the magnitude of the negative impact,\" a senior BOJ official told Reuters on Friday. The consumption tax is due to raised in April from three to five percent.", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 5, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"}, {"start": 69, "end": 74, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo"}, {"start": 98, "end": 103, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"}, {"start": 346, "end": 359, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan"}, {"start": 407, "end": 412, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"}, {"start": 617, "end": 633, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(Japan)"}, {"start": 852, "end": 856, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 929, "end": 933, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 953, "end": 959, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rubin"}, {"start": 961, "end": 966, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rubin"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1077, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sumitomo_Bank"}, {"start": 1091, "end": 1096, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rubin"}, {"start": 1135, "end": 1139, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1208, "end": 1221, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1435, "end": 1443, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sumitomo_Bank"}, {"start": 1489, "end": 1514, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Bank_of_Switzerland"}, {"start": 1518, "end": 1523, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo"}, {"start": 1941, "end": 1946, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"}, {"start": 2248, "end": 2251, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan"}, {"start": 2535, "end": 2555, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihon_Keizai_Shimbun"}, {"start": 2651, "end": 2654, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan"}, {"start": 2896, "end": 2901, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"}, {"start": 2964, "end": 2972, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan"}, {"start": 3018, "end": 3021, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan"}, {"start": 3139, "end": 3152, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_Suisse"}, {"start": 3156, "end": 3161, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo"}, {"start": 3170, "end": 3173, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan"}, {"start": 3485, "end": 3488, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan"}, {"start": 3503, "end": 3510, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}]}, {"text": "Britain 's Environment , Food and Rural Affairs Secretary George Eustice walks outside Downing Street in London , Britain , September 30 , 2020 .

LONDON 1996-08-31 Essex and Kent both face tense finishes on Monday as they attempt to keep pace with title hopefuls Derbyshire and Surrey, convincing three-day victors on Saturday, in the English county championship run-in. Essex need another 148 with five wickets in hand to beat Yorkshire after a maiden first-class century from Richard Kettleborough transformed a match which his side had seemed certain to lose. Kent will also need to keep their nerve against struggling Nottinghamshire who will enter the final day 137 ahead with four wickets left in a relatively low-scoring match at Tunbridge Wells. Derbyshire, nine-wicket winners over Worcestershire, and Surrey, who thrashed Warwickshire by an innings and 164 runs, can instead take the day off along with rivals Leicestershire, who beat Somerset inside two days. Warwickshire captain Tim Munton is tipping Surrey to emerge on top, impressed by the positive influence of Australian coach Dave Gilbert, but Derbyshire's Australian captain Dean Jones is conceding nothing as his side chase their first title for 60 years. \"We took three absolutely brilliant catches in this match and our catching all season has been pretty impressive.

Haitham Haddadin BEIRUT 1996-12-06 A Lebanese military court on Friday sentenced to death in absentia the commander of Israel's surrogate militia in south Lebanon on treason charges. The court convicted General Antoine Lahd, head of the South Lebanon Army (SLA), of collaborating with Israel with which Lebanon is officially at war. Lahd, a 69-year-old former Lebanese army major-general, heads the 3,000-strong SLA militia which helps Israel hold a border zone in south Lebanon to ward off cross-frontier guerrilla raids on northern Israel. Lahd said a few days after the trial began on February 16 that Lebanese authorities must drop the charges or risk blocking any peace deal with the Jewish state. He said Israel was capable of pressuring Lebanon's Syrian-backed government to stop the legal pursuit. The charges against Lahd were : forming a hostile army, carrying weapons on Israel's side, helping Israel strip off a part of Lebanese territory by violence, forming an armed gang, killing or trying to kill Lebanese civilians by artillery shelling and kidnapping Lebanese citizens for long periods. Shortly before Lahd's trial began, a Beirut military prosecutor charged another 89 former Lebanese army soldiers with collaborating with Israel. No date has been set for the trial of the men, all members of the SLA living in the Israeli-held zone in south Lebanon. Israel and Lahd have repeatedly demanded safety guarantees for the SLA-- a mixed Christian-Shi'ite Moslem force-- which the Jewish states regards as loyal allies. Israel has said the Lebanese army must incorporate the SLA fighters into its ranks as an army brigade as a condition for peace. But Lebanese political analysts have said that would be out of the question and Lebanese authorities pre-empted the issue by taking legal action against Lahd. Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, calling Lahd \"a great Lebanese patriot\", said earlier this year Lebanon had insulted the SLA commander by ordering his arrest on the treason charges. Peres, who was ousted in May by rightwing Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, said there could not be real negotiations with Lebanon \"unless it will stop the maltreatment of the SLA and its commanders.\" The Beirut military court also sentenced to life in jail in absentia Etian Saqr, former head of the pro-Israeli Guardians of the Cedars, a small rightwing Christian civil war militia. Saqr, whose trial was concurrent with Lahd's, was convicted of \"contacting the Israeli enemy, passing information to Israel and undertaking hostile acts against Lebanon\".", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 7, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 65, "end": 71, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut"}, {"start": 85, "end": 93, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 167, "end": 173, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 203, "end": 210, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 259, "end": 271, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lahad"}, {"start": 285, "end": 303, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lebanon_Army"}, {"start": 333, "end": 339, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 351, "end": 358, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 381, "end": 385, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lahad"}, {"start": 408, "end": 416, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 484, "end": 490, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 582, "end": 588, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 590, "end": 594, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lahad"}, {"start": 653, "end": 661, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 737, "end": 743, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews"}, {"start": 759, "end": 765, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 792, "end": 799, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 874, "end": 878, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lahad"}, {"start": 930, "end": 936, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 953, "end": 959, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 980, "end": 988, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 1061, "end": 1069, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 1117, "end": 1125, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 1168, "end": 1172, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Lahad"}, {"start": 1190, "end": 1196, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut"}, {"start": 1243, "end": 1251, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 1290, "end": 1296, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 1409, "end": 1416, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 1418, "end": 1424, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 1517, "end": 1523, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"start": 1542, "end": 1548, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews"}, {"start": 1581, "end": 1587, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 1601, "end": 1609, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 1713, "end": 1721, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 1789, "end": 1797, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 1875, "end": 1882, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 1898, "end": 1910, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Peres"}, {"start": 1934, "end": 1942, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 1976, "end": 1983, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 2062, "end": 2067, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Peres"}, {"start": 2104, "end": 2111, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 2119, "end": 2137, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu"}, {"start": 2186, "end": 2193, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}, {"start": 2268, "end": 2274, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beirut"}, {"start": 2333, "end": 2343, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etienne_Saqr"}, {"start": 2376, "end": 2399, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardians_of_the_Cedars"}, {"start": 2565, "end": 2571, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 2609, "end": 2616, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon"}]}, {"text": "Kedon Slovis threw five touchdown passes , four to Amon-Ra St. Brown in the first quarter , as No . 20 USC cruised to a 38-13 victory against Washington State on Sunday night in a Pac-12 Conference game at Los Angeles .

REUTERS / Francois Lenoir / File Photo / File Photo ANKARA ( Reuters ) - Turkey will not bow to threats in its dispute with Greece and Cyprus over maritime claims in the eastern Mediterranean , President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday as European Union foreign ministers met in Brussels to discuss the issue . But Erdogan also said Turkey wanted negotiations over the conflicting claims to continental shelves and rights to potential energy resources . The EU ministers were due to evaluate grounds for sanctions against Turkey . The bloc \u2019s leaders will then decide on Thursday whether to make good on their threat , after Turkey sent an exploration vessel into waters claimed by Greece . \u201c In the eastern Mediterranean issue , our country never sides with tension , but with peace , cooperation , fairness and implementing justice . The path to this goes through negotiations based on mutual respect , \u201d Erdogan said , repeating a call for a conference that involves all actors in the region . However , Turkey would not allow a \u201c pirate mentality \u201d shown by other countries to restrict it to a narrow strip of coastal water . \u201c We will not bow down to threats and blackmail ... We will not allow imperialist expansionism , \u201d he said . Tensions flared in August when Ankara sent a survey vessel to map out energy drilling prospects in waters also claimed by Greece . Ankara and Athens agreed to resume talks over their contested maritime claims in September , ending a 4-year hiatus . But Greece has since said it would not begin talks as long as Turkish vessels were in contested waters . The vessel , Oruc Reis , returned to port again last week . The EU \u2019s Parliament has called for sanctions against Turkey over Erdogan \u2019s visit to the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state of Northern Cyprus - which is recognised only by Ankara - and over the Turkish operations in the eastern Mediterranean , which it called illegal . France is leading the push in the EU to sanction Turkey at the summit on Dec. 10-11 .

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. 1996-12-06 Fourteen years after he bludgeoned and shot a man whose trailer home he robbed in 1982, John Mills Jr., 41, was put to death in Florida's electric chair Friday. As Glenn Lawhon, a rural Florida minister who is the victim's father, looked on, Mills was pronounced dead at 7:13 a.m. EST (1213 GMT) for the murder of Lester Lawhon. Speaking in Arabic, Mills made a final statement before an anonymous citizen flipped the switch that sent 2000 volts of electricity through his body, said Department of Corrections spokesman Eugene Morris, who was present at the execution. \"I bear witness that there is no God but Allah and I bear witness that the prophet Mohammed is the messenger of God,\" he quoted Mills as saying. Prison officials said they had no record of Mills ' official conversion, but they said that, on May 14, 1991, he had asked that a new name, Yuhanna Abdullah Muhammed, be added to his prison file, which is usually an indication of a conversion to Islam. Mills is the 38th person to die in Florida's electric chair since the U.S. Supreme Court reversed itself in 1976 and legalised the death penalty. Prison officials said Mills made no special request for a last meal and did not eat the steak, fried potatoes and orange juice offered him. He spent Thursday with family members and his spiritual adviser, Morris said. Mills was scheduled to die Wednesday but had his sentence temporarily postponed by the Florida Supreme Court. On Thursday, the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta denied his appeal in federal court. In March 1982, Mills and accomplice Michael Frederick knocked on the door of Lester Lawhon's trailer in an attempt to rob it, police said. Lester Lawhon was taken to a nearby airstrip where he was bludgeoned with a tire iron. Mills then fired two shots that killed Lawhon as the victim tried to run away.

Englishman Alliss , who was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame for his services to the sport in 2012 , died peacefully at his home on Saturday , the Tour added in a statement here . \u201c We are deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Peter Alliss , truly one of golf \u2019s greats , \u201d European Tour CEO Keith Pelley said . \u201c Peter made an indelible mark on everything he did in our game , but especially as a player and a broadcaster , and he leaves a remarkable legacy . Our thoughts are with his wife Jackie and the Alliss family . \u201d Having turned professional at the age of 16 in 1947 , Alliss started out as an assistant pro to his father , former golfer Percy Alliss , at Ferndown Golf Club before going on to enjoy success by making the Ryder Cup squad eight times . He won his first title at the 1952 Gor-Ray Cup , which was the PGA Assistant Professionals Championship at the time . Alliss represented Great Britain and Ireland in each Ryder Cup until 1969 with the exception of the 1955 edition , winning the title in 1957 .

Lynagh kicked five penalties and a conversion from his six attempts at goal to steer his multi-national Saracens side to a 25-23 home win and offer millionaire backer Nigel Wray an early return on his big investment in the north London club. French centre Philippe Sella also enjoyed a good game alongside Lynagh, although the home team scored only one try through England scrum-half Kyran Bracken. The new French connection at Harlequins also made a good start, Laurent Cabannes and Laurent Benezech scoring a try apiece in their side's 75-19 victory over Gloucester. Former England captain Will Carling, handed the kicking duties, finished with 20 points.

In sentencing Darrel Voeks, 38, to a 10-year prison term on Thursday, Outagmie County Circuit Court Judge Dennis Luebke said he was \"a thief by habit.\" \"You are self-indulgent. You are narcissitic,\" Luebke said at the sentencing, adding Voeks should pay restitution of more than $ 100,000 to the farming family who had hired him. Voeks, who was already on probation for prior pig thefts, pleaded that he was trying to pay bills for his ex-wife and children. But the court heard that receipts showed much of the money went to dancers at strip clubs where he was known as a big tipper.

Slideshow ( 5 images ) Turnout is expected to be lower than in past elections due to concern over COVID-19 , which along with low crude prices , has battered state finances in the wealthy oil-producing nation . Low turnout could strengthen the showing of tribal , Islamist and other candidates who can rally supporters to head to polling centres , analysts said . \u201c Kuwaiti opposition who boycotted ( previous ) polls are moving to run and vote , and this could strengthen their presence , \u201d said Kuwaiti political analyst Mohamad al-Dosayri . More than 300 candidates , including 29 women , are vying for 50 seats in the Gulf \u2019s oldest and most outspoken assembly with legislative powers . Critics say parliament has long stalled investment and economic and fiscal reform in the cradle-to-grave welfare state . Frequent clashes between the cabinet and assembly have led to successive government reshuffles and dissolutions of parliament . The emir , who has final say , picks a prime minister who selects a cabinet . The current government is due to resign after the elections . Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah took the reins as emir in September following the death of his brother . Campaigning , which took place mostly on social media and local TV channels due to COVID-19 measures against gatherings , has focused on the economy , corruption and demographics in a country where foreigners make up the bulk of the workforce . \u201c The issues are the same - health , education , housing - as none of these have been resolved yet , \u201d government employee Hamad al-Otaibi , 43 , told Reuters ahead of the elections . The nearly $ 140 billion economy is facing a deficit of $ 46 billion this year . A priority will be overcoming legislative gridlock on a bill that would allow Kuwait to tap international debt markets . OPPOSITION Sheikh Nawaf has called for unity to face challenges at home and in a region experiencing heightened tension between Kuwait \u2019s larger neighbours Saudi Arabia and Iran . Late ruler Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad in 2012 broke the hold of opposition groups on parliament by using executive powers to amend the voting system , sparking large protests . Under the old electoral system , voters were allowed to cast ballots for up to four candidates , which the opposition says allowed alliances that partly made up for the absence of political parties , which are officially barred . The system introduced in 2012 allows votes for only a single candidate , which the opposition says makes alliances difficult . Kuwaiti opposition figures have proposed electoral reforms and a pardon for dissidents , many in self-exile , to the new emir . \u201c There have been some reforms in the judiciary and the Emiri Diwan , \u201d or court , said a Kuwaiti politician who asked not to be named . \u201c We heard echoes of more reforms after elections . \u201d", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 6, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait_City"}, {"start": 9, "end": 16, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 21, "end": 29, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait"}, {"start": 75, "end": 79, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_states_of_the_Persian_Gulf"}, {"start": 348, "end": 356, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19"}, {"start": 514, "end": 522, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"start": 616, "end": 623, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait"}, {"start": 747, "end": 754, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait"}, {"start": 872, "end": 876, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_states_of_the_Persian_Gulf"}, {"start": 1337, "end": 1360, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawaf_Al-Ahmad_Al-Jaber_Al-Sabah"}, {"start": 1830, "end": 1837, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 2022, "end": 2028, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait"}, {"start": 2083, "end": 2088, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawaf_Al-Ahmad_Al-Jaber_Al-Sabah"}, {"start": 2193, "end": 2199, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait"}, {"start": 2221, "end": 2233, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia"}, {"start": 2238, "end": 2242, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran"}, {"start": 2263, "end": 2277, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabah_Al-Ahmad_Al-Jaber_Al-Sabah"}, {"start": 2774, "end": 2781, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait"}, {"start": 2992, "end": 2999, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait"}]}, {"text": "SOCCER - SCOTTISH LEAGUE RESULTS.

Today \u2019s rampant spread of the virus is bound with those facts : Local and state decisions to let the economy reopen as much as it did , as soon as it did , with public health rules spotty and unevenly enforced , set the stage for it to rotate through the country and eventually to spread unchecked .

U.S. payrolls grew by only 245,000 jobs in November , scant progress given that net job losses since February still total around 10 million . New data released in early December on state and metro level employment and wages by industry show just how unevenly the economic pain of those first months was spread . Indeed , while workers in New York City , one of the early epicenters of the U.S. outbreak , struggled with economic conditions reminiscent of the Great Depression last spring , workers in Montana , on the whole , earned about as much in the three months from April to June as they did in the prior three months . For workers in six western states , in fact , the second quarter of 2020 looked about the same as the second quarter of 2019 in terms of total wages collected , while in Nevada , Hawaii and Michigan wages were down more than 10 % from a year earlier . Graphic : A national crisis , unevenly shared The jobs crash was painful everywhere , particularly in the industries where people would be most vulnerable to a communicable disease - the close-contact services like restaurants , grooming parlors and gyms . Even in places where the initial crash was less intense , more than 8 % of jobs were lost from February to April . At its worst , in the U.S. Northeast and Hawaii , more than 20 % of jobs disappeared . But the places that suffered the lightest initial blow also more quickly regained lost employment , and in some instances by June had nearly regained all the lost jobs in April \u2019s wave of layoffs and closing . At that point the spread of the pandemic was also mild in those states , perhaps providing a reason to maintain a business-as-usual approach . Graphic : A national crisis , unevenly shared In urban areas the difference in outcomes was even more pronounced . Seasonal factors influence the numbers of jobs in some cities more than others . Beach towns and summer resorts see a bump when the weather warms . But comparing the number of jobs this June to a year ago shows how some fared better - or worse . Atlantic City , New Jersey , an oceanside resort and casino hub , had only 66 % of the jobs this past June that it did the year before . Cleveland , Tennessee , part of the U.S. South \u2019s emerging auto industry , by contrast , had more jobs in June than it did a year before . Graphic : A national crisis , unevenly shared Industries also felt those first months of the pandemic very differently . At first blush , hiring in some seasonal industries proceeded apace , with drive-in theaters , for example , staffing up for the summer : Employment there more than doubled from February to June , possibly a sign of entertainment migrating outdoors . Still , even such an industry well-suited to the moment saw its employment drop compared with a year earlier . By contrast , nursery and garden center employment rocketed nearly 30 % from February to June - a typical summertime jump . Nonetheless , it was also 1.7 % above the level from June 2019 . Graphic : A national crisis , unevenly shared At the other end of the scale , industries in the food and entertainment sectors saw job losses that may amount to a permanent shift in the economy and where people work .

NEW YORK 1996-12-06 NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures settled significantly lower Friday, pressured early by profit taking and driven even lower late by the National Weather Service's bearish six to 10 day forecast, sources said. January ended 29.7 cents lower at $ 3.487 per million British thermal units after dipping to a low of $ 3.46. Feb settled down 22 cents at $ 3.186. Most others also were down. \"Weather forecasts have been sketchy. Now the National Weather Service is calling for above-normal temperatures in more than half of the U.S.,\" one futures trader said. In its forecast, the NWS said it expects above-normal temperatures \"over the lower 48 states\" from December 12 through December 16. With more room to the downside anticipated early next week, traders said support in January was at $ 3.47, then $ 3.35. The next backstops were seen at $ 3.11 and $ 3.04, the low set on November 21. Resistance was pegged at the new contract high of $ 3.80. In the cash market, Gulf Coast prices were around $ 3.60 shortly before nomination deadlines. Midcontinent prices were similarly lower in the $ 3.40s. New York city gate gas slipped into the $ 4.40s, down almost 15 cents. NYMEX said an estimated 35,662 Hub contracts traded, down from Thursday's revised tally of 43,955. NYMEX Alberta natgas remained untraded, with January settling at $ 1.65, off 10 cents from Thursday. Physical prices for the weekend at the AECO storage hub were also down about 10 cents in the C$ 1.92-1.97 per gigajoule, or $ 1.52-1.56 per mmBtu range, pressured by unseasonably mild weather in western Canada. NYMEX Permian natgas, also untraded, ended 10 cents lower at $ 2.90. In congruence with futures, Permian cash prices for the weekend fell more than 10 cents to the high - $ 3.40s. On the KCBT, January finished 26.5 cents lower at $ 3.35 after dipping to a low of $ 3.33 earlier in the session. February was down 22 cents at the close, while other deferreds were 4.5 to nine cents lower. The East / West spread narrowed by 3.2 cents to 13.7 cents (NYMEX premium). Physical prices at Waha for the weekend lost more than 15 cents to the low-to-mid $ 3.50s as milder weather moved into the Southwest.-- H McCulloch, New York Power Desk+212-859-1628", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 5, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange"}, {"start": 52, "end": 60, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City"}, {"start": 72, "end": 77, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange"}, {"start": 206, "end": 230, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service"}, {"start": 333, "end": 340, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 501, "end": 525, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service"}, {"start": 592, "end": 596, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1033, "end": 1043, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States"}, {"start": 1107, "end": 1119, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States"}, {"start": 1164, "end": 1172, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City"}, {"start": 1235, "end": 1240, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mercantile_Exchange"}, {"start": 1340, "end": 1347, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta"}, {"start": 1638, "end": 1644, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"}, {"start": 1743, "end": 1750, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian"}]}, {"text": "( Reuters ) - An \u2018 overwhelmed \u2019 Mick Schumacher graduated to Formula One as the 2020 Formula Two champion on Sunday despite failing to score in his last race before joining the U.S.-owned Haas F1 team .

FILE PHOTO : South Korean President Moon Jae-in speaks at the National Assembly in Seoul , South Korea , October 28 , 2020 . Jeon Heon-Kyun / Pool via REUTERS The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency reported 615 new coronavirus cases as of midnight Sunday , capping a month of triple-digit daily increases that have led to 8,311 confirmed patients in quarantine , the most ever . The surge in cases has deliverd a blow to South Korea \u2019s vaunted pandemic-fighting system , which successfully used invasive tracing , testing , and quarantines to avoid lockdowns , blunt previous waves , and keep infections below 50 per day for much of the summer . Moon ordered the government to mobilize every available resource to track infections , and to expand testing by deploying the military and more people from the public service , presidential Blue House spokesman Chung Man-ho told a briefing . Moon said testing sites should operate longer hours to allow people working to get tested at their convenience and more drive-through testing facilities should be set up , Chung said . The positive rate for the latest batch of tests was about 4.2 % , compared to the year \u2019s average of 1.2 % , according to the KDCA . Starting next week , testing centres will begin using a test kit designed to more easily gather samples from saliva , hopefully reducing some of the difficulty they had faced when trying to collect usable samples , KDCA deputy director Na Seong-woong told a briefing . While questions remain over their accuracy , the centres will also start using antigen tests - which are supposed to detect specific proteins from the virus - as a stopgap , Na said . Na predicted that daily cases would hover between 550-750 for this week , possibly spiking to as much as 900 per day the next week . \u201c This crisis is the most critical yet , \u201d he said , warning that the outbreak could lead to a \u201c medical collapse \u201d if the numbers are n\u2019t contained . DEBATE OVER NEW MEASURES On Sunday , authorities said they will impose heightened social distancing rules for the capital Seoul and surrounding areas that will last until at least the end of the month . With this third wave , the government has faced increasing criticism as cases continue to rise despite measures such as mask mandates , curfews for restaurants and other businesses , and restricted public transportation . Among the facilities ordered to completely close are the private academies or cram schools , called \u201c hagwon \u201d , used by students for extra study . The Korea Association of Hagwons staged a rare public protest over the outright ban on hagwons opening in the greater Seoul area , saying it is discriminatory because other businesses including PC cafes and movie theatres frequented by students are still allowed to be open until 9 p.m . The ban has prompted concerns among many students and parents ahead of the final exam period , and would deepen inequality by boosting private tutoring that only well-off students can afford , it added . In comments to a meeting of his senior ministers , Moon called the wave of infections the most serious yet and apologised for failing to blunt the surge and for the burden caused by the social distancing restrictions . Monday \u2019s total was down slightly from Sunday , when the agency reported 631 new cases , the largest daily tally since a peak in February and early March .

Andy Colquhoun JOHANNESBURG 1996-08-31 South Africa managed to avoid a fifth successive defeat in 1996 at the hands of the All Blacks with an emphatic 32-22 victory in front of an ecstatic Ellis Park crowd on Saturday. They scored three tries in recording their highest total against New Zealand, salvaging some pride in a season in which the world champions have lost five out of eight tests. It also ended a run of nine successive victories this year for New Zealand but arrived too late to prevent a 2-1 series defeat and an historic first All Black series triumph on South African soil. Springbok scrum-half Joost van der Westhuizen was his side's inspiration, scoring their opening try and making the third for flanker Andre Venter from a quickly taken penalty to give his side a 29-8 lead after 54 minutes. Fullback Andre Joubert scored the other, scorching in from 40 metres at the start of the second half to add to his three long-range penalties. The All Blacks salvaged some pride by scoring two tries from centre Walter Little and scrum-half Justin Marshall in the final five minutes to close a gap which at one point stood at 24 points. But they generally endured an off-day, highlighted by recalled fly-half Andrew Mehrtens who missed five out of eight kicks at goal. Recalled fly-half Henry Honiball kicked the Springboks into a 6-0 lead after 10 minutes only to see Andrew Mehrtens launch a penalty from eight metres inside his own half to narrow the gap. Mehrtens missed three further penalties and a conversion in the first 40 minutes which could have put his side ahead, but it was the Springboks who looked the more dangerous. Their promise was realised when Joubert made a 40-metre break in the 25th minute and, although winger Pieter Hendriks appeared to knock on Joubert's reverse pass, Welsh referee Derek Bevan allowed Van der Westhuizen to pick up and score under the posts. Honiball converted and Joubert kicked a penalty before All Black hooker Sean Fitzpatrick scored a try from close range on the stroke of half-time to narrow the lead to 16-8 and hint at a comeback. Instead Joubert kicked another long penalty and then raced around the outside of the defence to score the Springboks ' second try. A quick penalty from Van der Westhuizen five metres from the All Black line set up the third try for Venter five minutes later and when Joubert kicked his third penalty the Springboks held an unassailable 32-8 lead going into the last quarter. When the All Blacks did break through, it was too late. Centre Walter Little followed up Mehrtens ' kick to score under the posts and scrum-half Justin Marshall forced himself over from a ruck close to the line in injury-time to give them some consolation.

CHICAGO 1996-12-06 As many as 1 million dog bites are recorded in the United States every year and half of them are provoked by humans, a veterinarian told fellow animal doctors on Friday. The Humane Society of the United States estimates that between 500,000 and one million bites are delivered by dogs each year, more than half of which are suffered by children. \"Most bites can be prevented by teaching children how to respect a dog,\" Michael Cornwell of the Glencoe Animal Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, told the annual meeting of the American Veterinary Medical Association. \"Let's not let our kids jump on them or crawl on them. Dogs and children do n't have to have an interaction. Let's respect their territories,\" he said. Cornwell said 50 percent of reported bites were provoked by a person and 60 percent were suffered by children. He also estimated that only 25 percent of bites were reported because medical attention was not needed. Don Rieck, president of the National Animal Control Association, said aggressiveness in dogs was related more to gender than breed and a male dog that had not been neutered was three times more likely to bite than an unspayed female. The five breeds credited with the most incidents were chow chows, Rottweilers, German shepherds, cocker spaniels and Dalmatians. \"The trends in dog bites by particular breeds have more to do with fad pets owned by individuals who need to have something unique. Speaking strictly of dogs, 15 years ago the macho fad pet was a Doberman. Today, Rottweilers are on the way up,\" Rieck said. If approached by a stray dog, children should be taught to stand still with fists folded underneath the neck, elbows in, and gaze forward until the dog goes away.", "value": [{"start": 33, "end": 41, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 47, "end": 54, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago"}, {"start": 117, "end": 130, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 240, "end": 275, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Humane_Society_of_the_United_States"}, {"start": 536, "end": 550, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio"}, {"start": 583, "end": 622, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Veterinary_Medical_Association"}, {"start": 1291, "end": 1302, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rottweiler"}, {"start": 1304, "end": 1320, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Shepherd_Dog"}, {"start": 1322, "end": 1337, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocker_Spaniel"}, {"start": 1342, "end": 1352, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalmatian_(dog)"}, {"start": 1550, "end": 1558, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doberman_Pinscher"}, {"start": 1567, "end": 1578, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rottweiler"}]}, {"text": "* Thailand markets closed for a holiday * Fitch downgrades Malaysia 's credit rating ; ringgit weaker * China Nov exports rise sharply By Anushka Trivedi Dec 7 ( Reuters ) - Indonesian shares hit a near 10-month high on Monday , while other Asian stock markets made modest gains as optimism over U.S. stimulus was overshadowed by a possible escalation in tensions between the United States and China . The Jakarta index jumped 1.7 % to lead gains after local media here reported over the weekend that the government would allow coronavirus vaccine usage , following which President Joko Widodo said that Indonesia had received its first shipment of vaccines from China . Indonesia has been among the hardest hit countries by the pandemic as its daily number of coronavirus infections has accelerated in recent weeks and its death toll remains the highest in Southeast Asia . However , other emerging Asian stock markets retreated from highs hit over vaccine optimism and the $ 908 billion aid bill in the United States after Reuters reported that President Donald Trump 's administration was preparing sanctions on some Chinese officials over the crackdown in Hong Kong . \" After an initial rise on U.S. stimulus hopes , early rallies quickly faded ... I expect the negativity in the major Asian markets to be short-lived , \" Jeffrey Halley , senior market analyst , Asia Pacific , at OANDA , wrote . In the long term , the news of stimulus should outweigh the negative headlines on geopolitical tensions , he added . Even upbeat trade data from China , the region 's economic engine , failed to spur a rally in Asian equities . Chinese exports rose at the fastest pace since February 2018 in November , jumping 21.1 % from a year earlier . Meanwhile , emerging Asian currencies were a shade higher against a flat dollar , with only the Taiwanese dollar a stand out at 0.9 % stronger . The ringgit was knocked 0.3 % lower after Fitch downgraded Malaysia 's credit rating on expectations of worsening fiscal pressure , increased debt and political uncertainty .

Evelyn Leopold UNITED NATIONS 1996-12-06 Four African states are ready to nominate candidates for the post of U.N. secretary-general on Friday now that Boutros Boutros-Ghali has temporarily put aside his bid for re-election. The nominees, according to diplomats, are : Kofi Annan of Ghana, the U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeeping ; Ahmedou Ould Abdallah of Mauritania, the former U.N. special envoy for Burundi ; Amara Essy of the Ivory Coast, its foreign minister and the U.N. General Assembly president in 1994-95 ; and Hamid Algabid of Niger, the secretary-general of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference. Representatives of the U.N. missions of Ghana, the Ivory Coast, Mauritania and Niger have scheduled a meeting with Security Council president Paolo Fulci of Italy to hand in the nominations in writing, the envoys said. It was not known if other candidates would step forward. Diplomats said General Joseph Garba of Nigeria, a U.N. General Assembly president in 1989-90, was putting forth his own candidacy without being nominated by his country. Boutros-Ghali on Wednesday opened the door for other Africans to contest his job by saying he was suspending temporarily his candidacy but was not withdrawing completely from the race. His supporters said this meant he remained a candidate in case the race reached an impasse.

The match boiled over when Hill made to walk off court after what he claimed was a game-winning point in the third. When the referee called Jansher's return good and the decision was accepted by the player, Hill shrieked at the Pakistani : \"You cheat.\" \"He was standing right there and knew the shot was down so I called him a cheat,\" said Hill, whose squash career has been blighted by fines and suspensions for unacceptable behaviour. \"He knew it was down and accepted what I called him because of that.\" Hill won the game on the next point and said later that Jansher was generally honest on court but played by the referee's decision. The Australian had upset Jansher's rhythm with his mixture of gamesmanship and fluent stroke-making but eventually succumbed 15-7 17-15 14-15 15-8. \"I changed my strategy against him today and had him rattled,\" he added. He is not as fit as he used to be be but was too good for me in the end. I shook him a bit but he will come out next time and be a better player for it-- that's Jansher. \"Jansher said that he was disturbed to be called a cheat.\" What he did was bad for squash, bad for the crowd and bad for the sponsors. \"We are trying to build up squash like tennis and players should not say things like that.\" I think the Professional Squash Association should look into this matter and deal with it properly. I am not calling for him to be banned but they have to take some action. \"Jansher, bidding for an eighth Hong Kong Open title, plays second-seeded Australian Rodney Eyles in the final. Eyles played his best squash of the tournament to beat fourth-seeded Peter Nicol of Scotland 15-10 8-15 15-10 15-4. Eyles, who defeated Jansher in the semifinals of the Portuguese Open in 1993, said that he would like to win for the good of the game.\" I have nothing against Jansher but it will be great if I could beat him, \"said Eyles.\" My biggest problem against Jansher is concentration.

The weekly government bond index rose 0.07 percent in local currency terms. France managed third place with 0.68 percent in the 16-nation world government bond index. Canada's were the worst performing bonds. They lost 2.21 percent, depressed by a wave of new Canadian supply. Returns on Treasuries were also in negative territory at minus 0.24 percent, the poorest result after Canada and British gilts which lost 0.28 percent. Australia was the only dollar-bloc country in the table to eke out a positive return, albeit a paltry 0.02 percent. German Bunds were not much better, offering returns of 0.05 percent, while Japanese government bonds managed a 0.38 percent gain. Spanish bonds, which had been top performers in Salomon Brothers ' league table for November as a whole, turned in a more subdued weekly performance with a return of only 0.27 percent.

MILWAUKEE, Wisconsin 1996-08-31 Jesper Parnevik of Sweden fired a course record-tying eight-under-par 63 Saturday to take a one-shot lead into the final round of the $ 1.2 million Greater Milwaukee Open. Parnevik, who is seeking his first PGA Tour victory, moved to 19-under 194 for the tournament. Parnevik tied the 18-hole record set by Loren Roberts in 1994 at the Brown Deer Park Golf Course and also equalled Saturday by Greg Kraft. Nolan Henke, who led by two strokes entering the third round, carded a four-under 67 and was one stroke back at 18-under 195. He is striving for his fourth career PGA Tour victory and first since the 1993 BellSouth Classic. Tiger Woods, who made the cut in his first tournament as a professional, shot a two-over-par 73 and was four under for the tournament. The 20-year-old Woods, who turned professional Tuesday after winning an unprecedented third successive U.S. Amateur Championship, struggled on the front nine, bogeying the first and seventh holes and double-bogeying the par-four, 359-yard ninth hole. After bogeying the 10th hole to move to four-over for the round, he rallied for birdies on 15 and 18. After Parnevik started off his round by parring the first hole and bogeying the second, the Swede birdied six of the next seven holes. Parnevik continued to storm through the course, birdying three holes on the back nine, including two from 12 feet out on the 15th and 17th holes. \"I ca n't remember when I've putted this well,\" said Parnevik. \"I was disappointed when a 12-footer did n't go in.\" My game feels very good. I've been fading my driver but today whenever I set up for a fade it went straight. Whenever everyone's making birdies, you never want to be even par. \"Henke had a bogey-free round and birdied four holes, including a 45-footer on the par-three 215-yard seventh hole and one from 12 feet out on the 12th hole.\" I did n't hit it very well today, \"said Henke.\" Jasper blew right by me. Once he did, I knew I had to make birdies just to keep up. I made some really good pars. I basically picked up where I left off yesterday afternoon. \"Right now, I ca n't put my finger on what's wrong.\" Bob Estes shot a 67 for sole possession of third place at 15-under.

Richard Finn NEW YORK 1996-08-31 This year's Fed Cup finalists-- defending champion Spain and the United States-- will hit the road to open the 1997 women's international team competition, based on the draw conducted Saturday at the U.S. Open. Spain travels to Belgium, while the U.S. team heads to the Netherlands for first-round matches March 1-2. The other two first-round ties will pit hosts Germany against the Czech Republic and visiting France against Japan. The semifinals are July 19-20, and the final September 27- 28. Life on the road this year did not slow the Americans, who will try to avenge their 3-2 defeat in the final last year when they host Spain on September 28-29 in Atlantic City. \"Last year we stood on the court after we had lost and we put out hands together and made it our committment to bring back the Cup,\" U.S. captain Billie Jean King said at the draw. \"That is our sole goal.\" The United States edged Austria in Salzburg 3-2 in the opening round in April, and then blanked Japan 5-0 in Nagoya last month in the semifinals. The victory against Japan marked the Fed Cup debut of Monica Seles, who became a naturalised U.S. citizen in 1994. Seles easily won both her singles matches and King is counting on the co-world number one to lead the team again. \"I told Monica we need her if we want to win,\" King said. Seles's sore left shoulder and a wrist injury to Fed Cup veteran Mary Joe Fernandez have forced King to take a wait and see attitude regarding her squad for the best-of-five match. Fernandez was forced to withdraw from the U.S. Open. \"We will wait until the last minute so we check with everybody and their injuries,\" said King. \"What we like would be Seles, (Olympic champion Lindsay) Davenport and Mary Joe Fernandez.\" If she can get that threesome together, King will feel good about her chances against the Spain's formidable duo of Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Conchita Martinez. \"To be a great coach you have to have the right horses and I got the right horses,\" said King.", "value": [{"start": 9, "end": 14, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain"}, {"start": 16, "end": 20, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 71, "end": 79, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City"}, {"start": 103, "end": 110, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fed_Cup"}, {"start": 142, "end": 147, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_Fed_Cup_team"}, {"start": 156, "end": 169, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Fed_Cup_team"}, {"start": 291, "end": 300, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)"}, {"start": 302, "end": 307, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_Fed_Cup_team"}, {"start": 319, "end": 326, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium"}, {"start": 338, "end": 342, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Fed_Cup_team"}, {"start": 361, "end": 372, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"}, {"start": 454, "end": 461, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_Fed_Cup_team"}, {"start": 474, "end": 488, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic_Fed_Cup_team"}, {"start": 502, "end": 508, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_Fed_Cup_team"}, {"start": 517, "end": 522, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Fed_Cup_team"}, {"start": 631, "end": 640, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 720, "end": 725, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_Fed_Cup_team"}, {"start": 748, "end": 761, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_City,_New_Jersey"}, {"start": 896, "end": 900, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 909, "end": 925, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Jean_King"}, {"start": 973, "end": 986, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Fed_Cup_team"}, {"start": 993, "end": 1000, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria_Fed_Cup_team"}, {"start": 1004, "end": 1012, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salzburg"}, {"start": 1065, "end": 1070, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Fed_Cup_team"}, {"start": 1078, "end": 1084, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagoya"}, {"start": 1135, "end": 1140, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Fed_Cup_team"}, {"start": 1152, "end": 1159, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fed_Cup"}, {"start": 1169, "end": 1181, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Seles"}, {"start": 1208, "end": 1212, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1230, "end": 1235, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Seles"}, {"start": 1352, "end": 1358, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Seles"}, {"start": 1402, "end": 1407, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Seles"}, {"start": 1451, "end": 1458, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fed_Cup"}, {"start": 1467, "end": 1485, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Joe_Fernandez"}, {"start": 1583, "end": 1592, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Joe_Fernandez"}, {"start": 1625, "end": 1634, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)"}, {"start": 1754, "end": 1759, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Seles"}, {"start": 1762, "end": 1769, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games"}, {"start": 1788, "end": 1797, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsay_Davenport"}, {"start": 1802, "end": 1820, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Joe_Fernandez"}, {"start": 1913, "end": 1918, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_Fed_Cup_team"}, {"start": 1939, "end": 1962, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arantxa_S\u00e1nchez_Vicario"}, {"start": 1967, "end": 1984, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conchita_Mart\u00ednez"}]}, {"text": "Two dead after executive jet crashes in Newfoundland.

The report, to be debated in parliament in coming weeks, was seen by Reuters on Friday. \"Officials say the minefields present an obstacle to the security forces,\" it said. It said Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) guerrillas sometimes know the layout of mined areas along the border better than the security forces. \"Terrorists and smugglers have dug up the mines, defused them and opened up wide paths in some areas. They can come in and out easily as the minefields are not an obstacle,\" it said. An armed forces spokesman was not available for comment. Turkey says Syria sponsors the PKK, fighting for Kurdish self-rule in southeast Turkey. Damascus denies aiding the rebels.

CINCINNATI 1996-08-31 Major league ERA leader Kevin Brown threw an eight-hitter and Devon White's RBI double snapped a fifth-inning tie as the Florida Marlins beat the Cincinnati Reds 3-1 for their seventh straight win Friday. Brown (14-10) tied Todd Stottlemyre of the Cardinals for the National League lead with his fifth complete game and lowered his major league-leading earned run average from 1.96 to 1.92. He struck out eight and did not walk a batter. Brown threw 119 pitches and won for the third time in as many starts against the Reds this season. \"Bolesy (Florida manager John Boles) told me yesterday, ' You have to go nine tomorrow, '\" Brown said. \"In the early innings, I was struggling, I was just trying to make it from pitch to pitch. I gave up a lot of hits in the early innings and I was n't thinking about the seventh, eighth or ninth. I was n't satisfied with any of my pitches and I did a better job of moving the ball around in the later innings.\" \"He has a devastating sinker,\" observed Reds manager Ray Knight. \"The guys say it moved more than everyone in the league. I remember Nolan Ryan saying in ' 91 or ' 92 that he was the best young pitcher coming around in a long time and he saw (Tom) Seaver and (Jerry) Koosman when they were starting.\" In Philadelphia, Delino DeShields's triple in the top of the 12th off Jeff Parrett (2-3) scored Chad Curtis and lifted the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 7-6 victory over the Phillies. Los Angeles won for the seventh time in eight games. Darren Dreifort (1-1) picked up the win after allowing a hit and a walk over 2 1/3 scoreless innings. Todd Worrell worked the 12th to earn his league-leading 37th save. The Phillies have dropped five of their last six overall, and nine of 11 at home. Billy Ashley belted a three-run homer for Los Angeles. In Chicago, the Braves and Cubs split a doubleheader. In the first game, Ryne Sandberg snapped an eighth-inning tie with an infield single and Kevin Foster (6-2) outdueled Atlanta's Tom Glavine (13-8) for his third straight win, 3-2. Foster, a.333 hitter, helped his own cause in the second with a two-run single. The Braves took the second game when Chipper Jones singled home the tying run in the top of the ninth and Andruw Jones took advantage of a poor throw to score the go-ahead run on a sacrifice fly for a 6-5 victory. Cubs shortstop Jose Hernandez committed three of Chicago's four errors. Mike Mordecai singled, doubled and homered for Atlanta, which has won 14 of its last 19 games and has the best record in the majors, 84-50. In Montreal, Scott Sanders allowed one hit over eight innings and Wally Joyner hit a two-run single in a four-run third as the San Diego Padres blanked the Expos 6-0 for their sixth straight win. Sanders (8-4) struck out 10 and walked three to win his fourth straight. He allowed a leadoff double to David Segui in the second, and won for the seventh time in eight decisions. The right-hander retired 14 batters in a row from the second inning through the seventh. Mike Oquist allowed one Montreal hit in the ninth. Montreal lost for the ninth time in 14 games. In New York, Marvin Benard's two-run homer snapped a tie and Shawn Estes came one out away from his first complete game as the San Francisco Giants beat the Mets 6-4. Benard, hitting.467 (14-for-30) against the Mets this season, hit his first pitch from Pete Harnisch (8-10) in the seventh over the right-field fence to put the Giants up 4-2. Estes (3-4) was lifted for closer Rod Beck after yielding a single with two out in the ninth. Beck allowed a two-run double to Alvaro Espinoza, who collected a career-high four RBI, but struck out Brent Mayne for his 31st save. The loss was the Mets ' eighth straight, their longest slide since September 1993, and dropped them to 0-4 under new manager Bobby Valentine. In St Louis, Tom Pagnozzi had three hits and three RBI and Alan Benes scattered six hits over six-plus innings as the Cardinals beat the Colorado Rockies 7-4. Benes (12-8) allowed three runs, walked three and struck out three for the win. St Louis defeated Colorado for just the second time in 12 meetings dating back to last season. Ray Lankford went 4-for-5 with a pair of doubles for the Cardinals, who won for just the third time in 11 games. Eric Anthony hit a pair of solo homers for the Rockies. In Pittsburgh, Sean Berry tied a career high with six RBI and Donne Wall fired a seven-hitter for his first major-league shutout as the Houston Astros routed the Pirates 10-0. It was the third time Berry had six RBI in one game. Wall (9-4) struck out four and walked none to post his second complete game of the season and third straight win.", "value": [{"start": 37, "end": 44, "tag":

Richard Finn NEW YORK 1996-08-30 Refusing to go quietly in the night, Stefan Edberg extended his stay at his 14th and last U.S. Open when Bernd Karbacher, trailing and hurting, quit in the fourth set of their second-round match Friday. The 30-year-old Edberg, a former two-time Open champion, had wrestled control of the match away from Karbacher when the German, hampered by a left hamstring injury, decided he could n't continue under the stadium lights at the National Tennis Centre. \"A win is a win. I'll take it,\" Edberg, who has announced that this will be his last Grand Slam event, said of the 3-6 6-3 6-3 1-0 victory. Ironically, Karbacher two years ago ended Ivan Lendl's Grand Slam career here when the former champion had to retire in the middle of their first-round match. After seeing the trainer come out early in the third set, Edberg was not surprised by Karbacher's decision not to go on. \"I knew he had problems with something,\" Edberg said. \"I really was n't surprised.\" Edberg had his own problems early in the match as the Swede battled to acclimate himself to the nighttime conditions while Karbacher was ripping passing shots and blasting serves past him. \"I did n't really feel good to begin with, I had problems finding the timing on the ball, seeing the ball,\" said Edberg, who upset Wimbledon champion and fifth-seeded Richard Krajicek in the first round. \"This was one of these matches where I did n't play up to my standard. I had to fight hard.\" Edberg's tenacity paid off in the second set. Edberg lost his own serve twice, but he rallied for three breaks of his own, the last to wrap up the set. \"That's where the match sort of changed,\" said Edberg. \"I think once I got that second set, I felt a lot better about my game.\" Edberg is starting to feel pretty good about postponing his swan song a lot longer. \"It does n't look all that bad,\" Edberg said of his path through the draw starting next with a match against Krajicek's Dutch countryman Paul Haarhuis. However, the 1991 and 1992 champion is not ready to start making plans to be in next week's final. \"I'm always being realistic,\" said Edberg. \"Like I said many times, I think it's a very little chance, but nothing is impossible. If I play great tennis, that could take me a long way.\" A lot of things can happen, like tonight. \"", "value": [{"start": 9, "end": 15, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Edberg"}, {"start": 52, "end": 60, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City"}, {"start": 109, "end": 122, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Edberg"}, {"start": 162, "end": 171, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)"}, {"start": 177, "end": 192, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernd_Karbacher"}, {"start": 291, "end": 297, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Edberg"}, {"start": 317, "end": 321, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)"}, {"start": 376, "end": 385, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernd_Karbacher"}, {"start": 395, "end": 401, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany"}, {"start": 502, "end": 524, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Tennis_Centre_(United_Kingdom)"}, {"start": 558, "end": 564, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Edberg"}, {"start": 611, "end": 621, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)"}, {"start": 678, "end": 687, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernd_Karbacher"}, {"start": 708, "end": 718, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Lendl"}, {"start": 721, "end": 731, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)"}, {"start": 883, "end": 889, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Edberg"}, {"start": 911, "end": 920, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernd_Karbacher"}, {"start": 987, "end": 993, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Edberg"}, {"start": 1030, "end": 1036, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Edberg"}, {"start": 1084, "end": 1089, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden"}, {"start": 1153, "end": 1162, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernd_Karbacher"}, {"start": 1332, "end": 1338, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Edberg"}, {"start": 1350, "end": 1359, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships"}, {"start": 1386, "end": 1402, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Krajicek"}, {"start": 1516, "end": 1522, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Edberg"}, {"start": 1562, "end": 1568, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Edberg"}, {"start": 1715, "end": 1721, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Edberg"}, {"start": 1796, "end": 1802, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Edberg"}, {"start": 1913, "end": 1919, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Edberg"}, {"start": 1989, "end": 1997, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Krajicek"}, {"start": 2000, "end": 2005, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands"}, {"start": 2017, "end": 2030, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Haarhuis"}, {"start": 2166, "end": 2172, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Edberg"}]}, {"text": "ACCESS energy futures prices add to daytime gains.

WASHINGTON 1996-12-05 The United States Thursday blasted the release from a Greek prison of a Palestinian guerrilla convicted of bombing an airliner and killing a teenager in 1982, saying the move \"does not make sense.\" \"All of us who have been victimised by terrorists... need to stand together against terrorists. We ca n't let terrorists out of jail when they are a danger to civilians all around the world,\" State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said. ' Mohammed Rashid \"is a terrorist who deserves to be behind bars. It is inexplicable to us why he would have been allowed to leave Greece before serving his just sentence... This is an incomprehensible move. It does not make sense,\" Burns told a news briefing. He spoke after Rashid left Greece Thursday on being freed from prison early for good behaviour after serving 8-1/2 years. The Clinton administration's strong views on this subject have been conveyed to the Greek government, Burns said. Mahammad Rashid was whisked from Korydallos maximum security prison just outside Athens to the airport where he boarded a regular Olympic Airways flight to Cairo where he would transit to Tunis and the former Palestine Liberation Organisation headquarters. Rashid, 46, was sentenced to 18 years in prison by a Greek court in 1992 after being convicted of premeditated murder in the mid-air bombing of a Pan American airliner in 1982. His sentence had been reduced to 15 years in 1993. A parole court ruled recently that Rashid could be freed after serving 8-1/2 years, with time in pre-trial detention counted towards his term, but said he must be expelled immediately from Greece. The United States accuses Rashid of belonging to the May 15 Palestinian guerrilla group and being an accomplished student of master Palestinian bombmaker Abu Ibrahim. Three FBI agents who testified against Rashid during the trial, held at Korydallos prison, said they had ample evidence against Rashid for a bomb planted on a Pan American plane in Brazil in 1982 and a mid-air bomb blast on a TWA airliner approaching Athens in 1986 which killed four U.S. citizens.", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 4, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 41, "end": 51, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C."}, {"start": 67, "end": 80, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 117, "end": 122, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece"}, {"start": 135, "end": 146, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine"}, {"start": 453, "end": 469, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State"}, {"start": 480, "end": 494, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Nicholas_Burns"}, {"start": 632, "end": 638, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece"}, {"start": 734, "end": 739, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Nicholas_Burns"}, {"start": 789, "end": 795, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece"}, {"start": 888, "end": 895, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton"}, {"start": 968, "end": 973, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece"}, {"start": 1079, "end": 1085, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens"}, {"start": 1128, "end": 1143, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Airlines"}, {"start": 1154, "end": 1159, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo"}, {"start": 1186, "end": 1191, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunis"}, {"start": 1207, "end": 1240, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization"}, {"start": 1308, "end": 1313, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece"}, {"start": 1401, "end": 1413, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_American_World_Airways"}, {"start": 1672, "end": 1678, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece"}, {"start": 1684, "end": 1697, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 1740, "end": 1751, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine"}, {"start": 1812, "end": 1823, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine"}, {"start": 1853, "end": 1856, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation"}, {"start": 2006, "end": 2018, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_American_World_Airways"}, {"start": 2028, "end": 2034, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil"}, {"start": 2073, "end": 2076, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_World_Airlines"}, {"start": 2098, "end": 2104, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens"}, {"start": 2131, "end": 2135, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}]}, {"text": "SOCCER - AUSTRIA DOMINATE SCOTLAND IN WORLD CUP QUALIFIER.

Scotland, who thrashed Belarus 5-1 in their opening group four match, were unable to repeat their performance. Austria's best chance came in the 63rd minute with Stephan Marasek of SC Freiburg taking advantage of a scramble in the Scottish penalty area but his shot narrowly passing the left-hand post. They also went close a minute before the interval when a promising attack saw the ball fall to Markus Schopp but he hit his shot wide. Everton's Duncan Ferguson went close for Scotland in the 65th minute when he forced Austrian goalkeeper Michael Konsel to a diving save. Two Scotland players were shown yellow cards, captain Gary McAllister for bringing down Andreas Heraf and Ferguson for arguing against the referee's decision. \"The result is acceptable,\" Scottish coach Craig Brown told reporters. \"We'd hoped not to lose and we tried not to play for a draw but the Austrian defence was simply too good.\" SK Rapid's Dietmar Kuehbauer, who gave an impressive performance, said the team started off well but let the game slip after the first 30 minutes. \"Somehow it seemed there were less than 11 players on the pitch. We have lost two points. The Scots are not really a great team and we should have won,\" he said.

Elif Kaban GENEVA 1996-12-06 In a gloomy Geneva conference centre built before the dawn of the Internet, groups of staid officials made a first stab on Friday at rewriting copyright laws for the digital age. But critics at the first government-level meeting to revise copyright laws in 25 years said the officials and legislators might as well be trying to police the ether. After four days of diplomatic wrangling over procedures, some 600 delegates from nations small and large got down to the nitty-gritty of setting the digital agenda for the first time. Cyberspace squabbles overshadowed the debate on a stack of proposals covering literary and artistic works, the rights of performers and producers of music and producers of databases. \"If it goes on like this, we wo n't have enough time to finish all the discussions,\" a frustrated Western delegate said. \"They announced they will start evening sessions next week.\" Attempts by copyright-based industries to ensure they get a cut from online works led to a storm of protests by Internet companies and critics who say the pacts would curb public access to online information from soccer results to stock prices. \"It's not illegal to make photocopies of newspaper articles. It's fair use. We can read sports statistics or stock prices. But with the treaty, this kind of fact will be owned and subject to licensing,\" said James Love, a consumer lobbyist heading the Washington-based Consumer Project on Technology. \"None of the treaties are ready to move. These people do n't understand what they're doing.\" At stake are billions of dollars and the future of the electronic information industry-- the coming medium for the distribution of music, films, literature, software and commerce. Supporters of the three pacts say they are only an extension of existing intellectual property rights, covered by the century-old Berne Convention. But an array of opponents from the network industry to consumer, scientific and academic groups say the pacts will give sweeping powers to entertainment and copyright-based industries. A quick survey at the conference centre found few officials who had actually surfed the Internet. Mongolia's state copyright official, Gundegma Jargalshaihan, said apologetically that he had just arrived from Ulan Bator and was not aware of the details of the digital agenda. \"We do n't have money for Internet in Mongolia,\" he added. Alexander Bavykin, deputy legal chief at Russia's foreign ministry, said Moscow had yet to formulate a policy on copyright in cybersppace. He too had never browsed the Net. \"I've never tried it and why should I? There are lots of other things in this life I have n't tried either,\" he said. A visit to the computer centre offering Internet services found a lone European official clicking away on his mouse. \"Internet is a potential cash cow for copyright-based industries and we need roadmaps on the information superhighway,\" said Marc Pearl, vice-president of the Information Technology Association of America, a trade association of U.S. network companies opposing the treaties. \"But there are a lot of dinosaurs here. People here do n't understand Internet technology. Because they do n't understand technology, they fear the unknown.\" Before the Internet, those whose business was to protect copyrights knew where they stood.

PARIS 1996-08-31 Euro 96 absentee Nicolas Ouedec and Youri Djorkaeff scored the goals as 1998 World Cup hosts France beat Mexico 2-0 in a friendly international on Saturday. The victory extended to 29 matches France's unbeaten run under coach Aime Jacquet, their Euro 96 semifinal elimination having come in a penalty shoot-out, but was marred by the sending-off of Chelsea central defender Franck Leboeuf. Leboeuf was dismissed two minutes from time for a second bookable offence, fouling Mexican substitute Ricardo Pelaez who minutes earlier had also been shown the yellow card for pushing the Chelsea defender in the back. Both goals came early in the second half after France had surprised the Mexicans with three half-time substitutions. After a sterile first half, France injected more sting in midfield with the introduction of Juventus's Zinedine Zidane. This allowed Djorkaeff to play further up and his cross from the right fell for Ouedec, who has joined Espanyol of Barcelona from Nantes since missing the European championship finals through injury, to score after a mistake by midfielder Joaquin del Olmo. Within four minutes Ouedec was returning the compliment for Djorkaeff, playing a one-two with the Internazionale Milan forward down the middle to set him up for a cross shot past diving goalkeeper Osvaldo Sanchez. Jacquet, beginning the 22-month countdown to France's hosting of the World Cup finals, said : \"We have an identity (as a team) which we are going to work on.\" Teams : France - 1 - Bernard Lama ; 2 -

Bert Lauwers BRUSSELS 1996-08-31 Belgium kicked off their 1998 World Cup campaign with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over 10-man Turkey in a tense match marred by Turkish crowd trouble shortly after the break. Turkish fans, upset at their team's 2-0 first-half deficit, ripped apart dozens of plastic seats and threw them over the fence. Riot police took 10 minutes to restore order. The police were given an unexpected hand by second-half substitute Sergen Yalcin who rekindled Turkish hopes in the 61st with a splendid half-volley which stunned Belgian goalkeeper Filip De Wilde. But Yalcin, who had come on just four minutes earlier, turned from hero to villain barely two minutes after his strike when he was sent off after spitting at an opponent and arguing with English referee David Elleray. Marc Degryse had opened the scoring for Belgium after 13 minutes, whacking a low 10-metre drive into the net after an incisive pass by defender Dirk Medved from the edge of the penalty area. Brazilian-born Luis Oliveira then gleefully slipped the ball past goalkeeper Rustu Recber from the right of the area to make it 2-0 seven minutes before the interval, Turkey's best first-half effort proving to be a vicious 30-metre shot by Ogun Temizkanoglu which De Wilde tipped over. The visitors, seeking to restore some pride after failing to score a single goal in Euro 96 in June, repeatedly ripped through the left side of the home defence but De Wilde was able to block several sharply-angled efforts. With only the group seven winners qualifying automatically for the 1998 finals in France, Belgium could not afford a slip-up at home and they frantically chased a decisive third goal. But they were almost upset 12 minutes from time when De Wilde fumbled a hard Arif Erdem shot and Orhan Cikirikci almost pounced on the loose ball. Belgium's best second-half effort came three minutes later when Degryse put the ball over the bar from close range with Recber beaten.

Belgian coach Wilfried Van Moer said he had not expected Turkey to be so strong and fast. \"We started panicking a bit after the Turkish goal... we suffered,\" said Van Moer, who succeeded Paul Van Himst as coach in April.

MANTUA, Italy 1996-12-06 Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro visited the symbolic heartland of the separatist Northern League on Friday and appealed to its supporters to drop their campaign for a breakaway state. Addressing a convention on Italian unity in Mantua, where the party has set up its own \"parliament of the north\", Scalfaro made a direct appeal to what he called \"my friends from the League\" to work instead for federal reform. \"It is an invitation, a commitment, a promise. Let's march together,\" Scalfaro, a northerner himself, said. \"Help Italy to teach, to propose a capacity for strong local autonomy, for the federalism which can give new vigour to our blood. But turn back from the line you are taking now,\" he said. Scalfaro was in Mantua to attend a ceremony commemorating the executions there by Austrian rulers in 1852 and 1853 of a group of Italians who had campaigned for national unity. He was jeered and whistled at by a small group of League supporters when he arrived for a visit marked by heavy security. Witnesses said the protesters were outnumbered by other Italians who waved tricolour flags in the national red, white and green or shouted \"Viva Italia\". The League won more than eight percent of votes at the last general election in April on a federalist platform but its leader Umberto Bossi later switched to a separatist agenda.

Member of Parliament Tony Marlow said the resignation of the chancellor of the exchequer was the only way to make the Conservatives electable in a general election which must take place by May next year. \"We have a divided and split Cabinet.

Clarke denied on Thursday he had threatened to resign and said his position on the single currency was in tune with that of Prime Minister John Major. Major told parliament on Thursday he would keep his options open on single-currency membership.

The Sunday Telegraph quoted Majorie Orr as saying she did a horoscope chart for Thatcher, a Libran, after she narrowly escaped death in the Irish guerrilla bombing of a hotel during the Conservative Party conference more than a decade ago. Orr said Thatcher's press secretary Bernard Ingram asked her to telephone if she saw any threatening indications in the future. \"Bernard Ingham told me that if I ever heard anything that indicated danger I was to let him know,\" Orr said. Orr said she never had to telephone. She added that the horoscope was purely for security purposes and she was never consulted about political moves. Ingram was quoted as telling the newspaper he thought astrology was \"a load of rubbish\" and that he could not recall asking Orr to keep a watch on Thatcher's stars. Thatcher, dubbed the \"Iron Lady\" for her driven, forceful personality, was never known to have an interest in the occult and in fact has a university degree in chemistry.

The court said inquiry head Chris Hunt might be biased, since he privately told a newspaper he had turned up no major evidence of paedophile activity, even though he still had months ' of investigation before him. \"Today we are left with a ruinous wreck beyond salvage and a continuing pall of doubt and suspicion hanging over our diplomatic service,\" opposition foreign affairs spokesman Laurie Brereton said. But the government responded by pressing ahead with the original inquiry, established in May, appointing a new head to lead it. Critics say that if there were many paedophiles in senior posts in the Foreign Affairs Department then a secret inquiry would be open to internal influence and would become a public service whitewash. Accordingly, they demand an open investigation. A spokesman for Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said the appointment of a new inquiry head, administrative law expert Pamela O'Neil, showed the government's commitment to pursue the matter. A report is due in May next year. One Australian diplomat has been prosecuted this year for having sex with a Cambodian boy under 16 but was acquitted. Police have investigated others.

Blair once pledged to set up a Scottish parliament if the Labour won the next general election, which must be held by May 1997.

Constand Viljoen, leader of the Freedom Front party, told a news conference in Pretoria self-determination for Afrikaners could begin at local government level. \"Certain powers can be delegated from the provincial level, towards the sub-regions,\" he said. \"We think that the Afrikaner model within this new, multi- ethnic society of South Africa will have to develop experimentally with world thinking in this regard.\" Viljoen broke with other right-wing whites in 1994 by taking part in the country's first all-race elections in April of that year, saying the only way to attain self-determination was by cooperating with President Nelson Mandela's majority African National Congress. Some right-wingers demanded sovereignty in their own territory in the run-up to the elections, saying the alternative was war. Their threats came to nothing. Viljoen has hailed clauses in South Africa's new constitution as making possible a form of self-rule for the Afrikaners, descendants of the country's Dutch, German and French settlers.

Adults in the crowd carried posters of former Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev-- who declared independence in 1991-- and children, carrying photographs of him, called \"Troops out!\". Russian military officials have expressed fears that the rebels and their supporters will see the deal signed by Russian peace envoy Alexander Lebed in the early hours of Saturday as a military victory for the separatists. It involves the withdrawal of Russian troops sent to Chechnya in December 1994 to crush the separatists and a postponement of the issue at the heart of the conflict-- the status of the mainly-Moslem North Caucasus region. But the people in the crowd on Saturday, who had turned out in support of the rebels, did not seem sure that the war was over. \"We hope for the best, that it really has ended so we can live in peace. It's our only dream,\" said a 30-year-old woman, Mubatik Dagayeva. Aiza Dudayeva, with her 10-year-old son beside her, shared the guarded optimism. \"We really want the war to end, we hope and believe that our sons and brothers will win,\" said Dudayeva, adding that she was from Urus-Martan. Urus-Martan is a traditionally anti-separatist pocket in Chechnya and Moscow-backed leader Doku Zavgayev, who has been sidelined in the peace deal, has warned that it and places like it could become centres of civil war if Russian troops leave. But on Saturday the people gathered just outside the town seemed to be united in favour of the separatists. Two columns of rebels appeared in jeeps and cars, firing their guns in the air, as the crowd rushed towards them. Mouldi Mamatuyev, in his late 20's, dressed in black and carrying a machine gun, was welcomed by his mother and sister. \"Two sons have come back,\" said his mother Nurbika Mamatuyeva. \"It's the end. We believe in God.\" Mamatuyev joked that his sister Lisa was a rebel too, and she responded by grabbing hold of his gun and shouting the Chechen war cry \"Allahu Akhbar\" (God is Greatest) and \"Freedom for Chechnya!\". The fighter, sitting next to a man dressed in green and carrying a grenade-launcher, said that the strict Islamic law adopted by the rebels during the conflict was now needed to impose peace. \"The war has ended if everything works out, if there is law there will be power. Only Sheriat (Islamic law) can end the war.\"", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 8, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya"}, {"start": 68, "end": 79, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urus-Martan"}, {"start": 81, "end": 87, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}, {"start": 126, "end": 134, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya"}, {"start": 372, "end": 383, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urus-Martan"}, {"start": 456, "end": 462, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grozny"}, {"start": 600, "end": 607, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya"}, {"start": 615, "end": 631, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dzhokhar_Dudayev"}, {"start": 735, "end": 742, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}, {"start": 848, "end": 855, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}, {"start": 868, "end": 883, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Lebed"}, {"start": 988, "end": 995, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}, {"start": 1011, "end": 1019, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya"}, {"start": 1157, "end": 1171, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Caucasus"}, {"start": 1657, "end": 1668, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urus-Martan"}, {"start": 1670, "end": 1681, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urus-Martan"}, {"start": 1727, "end": 1735, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya"}, {"start": 1761, "end": 1774, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doku_Zavgayev"}, {"start": 1893, "end": 1900, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}, {"start": 2349, "end": 2352, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God"}, {"start": 2472, "end": 2479, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya"}, {"start": 2505, "end": 2508, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God"}, {"start": 2539, "end": 2547, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechnya"}, {"start": 2657, "end": 2664, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam"}, {"start": 2829, "end": 2836, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia"}]}, {"text": "Bre-X, Barrick said to continue Busang talks. K.T. Arasu JAKARTA 1996-12-06 Canada's Bre-X Minerals Ltd and Barrick Gold Corp are to continue negotiations to hammer out a partnership agreement to develop the spectacular Busang gold find in Indonesia, sources close to the talks said on Friday. \"The negotiations will be held both in Toronto and in Jakarta,\" one source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. Another source said most of the key negotiators from both Bre-X and Barrick had returned to Toronto, but declined to say if there had been any progress in their negotiations. Both sources said Bre-X and Barrick did not hold talks on Thursday with Mines and Energy Ministry Secretary-General Umar Said, who is coordinating the negotiations over the Busang find in East Kalimantan. The first source also said Bre-X had until December 21 to submit to the Indonesian Mines and Energy Ministry a feasibility study on the central region of the Busang property, estimated to contain 2.6 million ounces of gold. The richest parts of the property to the north and south of the central region have been estimated by Bre-X to contain 57 million ounces of gold. \"Bre-X is expected to complete the feasibility report by December 16 and submit it to the government before the December 21 deadline,\" the source said. He said Bre-X would then formally seek the permission of the Indonesian government to begin construction to develop Busang's central region, which might take up to two years. The source declined to say if there had been any progress in the talks between Bre-X and Barrick. \"This is a huge project... we are not selling furniture, and Bre-X has 13,000 shareholders to answer to,\" the source said. \"While there has been some agreement in principle on some issues, there are still others such as procedures and mechanisms that needed to be sorted out,\" he added. The source said no new deadline had been set by the Mines and Energy Ministry for Bre-X and Barrick to strike a deal. The Ministry had given the companies until December 4 to complete a partnership deal, and advised Bre-X to take a 25 percent stake and Barrick 75 percent to develop the property. \"As far as I am aware, there's been no new deadline,\" the source said. The Ministry's Umar said on Thursday that both Bre-X and Barrick had responded positively to a government letter recommending a 25-75 split in the Busang gold property. The government also wants 10 percent of the property. Umar said the government had yet to receive a formal reply from the companies. He had said earlier that if the two companies failed to reach a partnership agreement, the government would explore other ways to expedite development of the Busang find. Bre-X has a partnership deal with PT Panutan Duta of the Panutan Group run by President Suharto's eldest son, Sigit Harjojudanto, under which Panutan would receive $ 40 million over 40 months plus a 10 percent stake Busang's richest parts. Barrick has teamed up with a construction company in the Citra Group of Suharto's eldest daughter, Siti Hardianti Rukmana, in what Barrick had said was a partnership \"to prepare us for a potential mining development project\".", "value": [{"start": 7, "end": 14, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrick_Gold"}, {"start": 57, "end": 64, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta"}, {"start": 76, "end": 82, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada"}, {"start": 108, "end": 125, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrick_Gold"}, {"start": 240, "end": 249, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia"}, {"start": 333, "end": 340, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto"}, {"start": 348, "end": 355, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta"}, {"start": 411, "end": 418, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"start": 488, "end": 495, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrick_Gold"}, {"start": 512, "end": 519, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto"}, {"start": 623, "end": 630, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrick_Gold"}, {"start": 783, "end": 798, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Kalimantan"}, {"start": 872, "end": 882, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia"}, {"start": 1383, "end": 1393, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia"}, {"start": 1586, "end": 1593, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrick_Gold"}, {"start": 1974, "end": 1981, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrick_Gold"}, {"start": 2135, "end": 2142, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrick_Gold"}, {"start": 2307, "end": 2314, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrick_Gold"}, {"start": 2811, "end": 2818, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suharto"}, {"start": 2963, "end": 2970, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrick_Gold"}, {"start": 3035, "end": 3042, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suharto"}, {"start": 3094, "end": 3101, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrick_Gold"}]}, {"text": "Polish group to bid for Ruch newsstand chain - paper. WARSAW 1996-08-31 A Polish consortium including the Bank Rozwoju Exportu SA (BRE) plans to rival France's Hachette in bidding for Polish state-owned press distribution chain Ruch SA, Zycie Warszawy daily said on Saturday. Zycie Warszawy said its own publisher, mineral water firm Multico, and a group headed by Polish businessman Zygmunt Solorz were forming a consortium which would offer about $ 120 million, with finance provided by BRE. The consortium wanted 40 percent of Ruch's shares, the state would get 20 percent of Ruch and 40 percent would be offered on the Warsaw stock exchange. \"This division would guarantee a dispersal of capital, preventing anyone from taking total control over Ruch and dictating market conditions,\" the paper quoted one of the initiators of the move as saying, without giving a name. A consortium of press distributor Hachette and Polish publishers group UWP are seeking more than than 50 percent of Ruch and French President Jacques Chirac is likely to support its case when he visits Poland in September, the daily said. News-stand chain Ruch, which controls about 65 percent of Poland's press distribution market, had a net profit of 16.2 million zlotys on sales of 2.7 billion zlotys in 1995. It has about 17,000 news-stands and was the country's sole press distributor before the 1989 fall of communism. Zycie Warszawy said the new, open consortium, which also included several listed Polish firms, would on Monday inform Privatisation Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek of its plans. It aims to invest $ 200 million in Ruch over five years-- more than the sum Ruch says it needs to upgrade its outlets. Initially Poland offered up to 75 percent of Ruch but in March Kaczmarek cancelled the tender and offered a minority stake with an option to increase the equity. Two consortia-- UWP-Hachette and a consortium of a Polish SPC group and Swiss firms-- placed initial bids. But after the change of tender conditions Swiss investors pulled out and SPC decided to bid jointly with UWP-Hachette. Kaczmarek said in May he was unhappy that only one investor ended up bidding for Ruch, in which the government was initially offering up to 35 percent of shares with an option to extend the holding after investment promises are fulfilled.-- Anthony Barker+48 22 653 9700", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 6, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 54, "end": 60, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw"}, {"start": 74, "end": 80, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 151, "end": 157, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"start": 160, "end": 168, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachette_(publisher)"}, {"start": 184, "end": 190, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 237, "end": 251, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u017bycie_Warszawy"}, {"start": 276, "end": 290, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u017bycie_Warszawy"}, {"start": 365, "end": 371, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 384, "end": 398, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygmunt_Solorz-\u017bak"}, {"start": 623, "end": 629, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw"}, {"start": 908, "end": 916, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachette_(publisher)"}, {"start": 921, "end": 927, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 999, "end": 1005, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France"}, {"start": 1016, "end": 1030, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Chirac"}, {"start": 1076, "end": 1082, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 1171, "end": 1177, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 1399, "end": 1413, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u017bycie_Warszawy"}, {"start": 1480, "end": 1486, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 1701, "end": 1707, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 1904, "end": 1910, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland"}, {"start": 1925, "end": 1930, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"}, {"start": 2002, "end": 2007, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland"}]}, {"text": "Honda RV exceeds sales target.

Ramthan Hussain SINGAPORE 1996-12-06 Singapore's winning campaign to host the World Trade Organisation (WTO)'s first ministerial meeting reflected its ambition to play a key role in shaping global free trade, the lifeblood of its economy, analysts said. \"As one of the world's most externally oriented economies, Singapore has a disproportionately large stake in the WTO,\" said Desmond Supple, economist at research house I.D.E.A. \"Singapore stands to benefit more than most from continued global trade liberalisation as trade is the engine of its growth, accounting for nearly three times its gross domestic product.\" The city-state met U.S. opposition two years ago in its bid to host the meeting, expected to gather 4,000 officials from 160 countries from December 9 to 13. In a stand some analysts linked to controversy over Singapore's caning of an American teenager for vandalism, then-U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor had said the meeting ought to be held where the WTO was going to be headquartered. That would have meant Geneva. But Singapore had the support of other WTO members. Derek da Cunha, senior fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies (ISEAS), said Singapore's hosting of the conference \"carries a great deal of symbolism for the city-state, underscoring its commitment to free trade and its trading links across the globe.\" There is the international prestige Singapore would enjoy, but \"more importantly there is a genuine national interest in fostering better global free trade and an open market\", said Tan Kong Yam, head of Business Policy at the National University of Singapore. At the ministerial meeting, trade ministers will review the work of the WTO and the implementation of the Uruguay Round free trade commitments under its predecessor the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). In June, the WTO hailed Singapore for its open market policies but the European Union and other trading powers called on Singapore to speed up the opening of its services sector. Supple said the struggle that Singapore had to wage in vying to host the meeting would be repeated during the talks. \"There is tension at every step of the way,\" since a battle line between the West and developing countries has been drawn over the issue of linking trade liberalisation with labour rights, he said. Supple said hosting the meeting carried prestige for Singapore, \"however, this is quite intangible as the prestige factor may not necessarily lead to any additional investment and trade flows to this region.\" From a commercial point of view, the meeting would be good for Singapore's tourism industry, Tan said. A large part of Singapore's workforce would be mobilised to ensure the meeting would run without a glitch but the average Singaporean \"would probably not be too concerned about some of the issues,\" Tan said. \"But the more educated public will realise that these kind of things are important for Singapore as a small economy.\" Supple said any political gains the Singapore government would get from the WTO meeting-- ahead of a general election due by April 1997-- would depend on how successful it was in pushing its economic agenda. \"If there are any movements toward freer trade, then Singapore's economy and the electorate would gain,\" he said. \"But I do n't think it would be wise to play up the political aspect of this. I think political issues will take secondary importance to all these economic issues that will be displayed.\"", "value": [{"start": 10, "end": 19, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 66, "end": 75, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 87, "end": 96, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 128, "end": 152, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"}, {"start": 363, "end": 372, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 482, "end": 491, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 688, "end": 692, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 879, "end": 888, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 904, "end": 912, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 937, "end": 946, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 968, "end": 981, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Kantor"}, {"start": 1087, "end": 1093, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva"}, {"start": 1099, "end": 1108, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 1134, "end": 1137, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"}, {"start": 1184, "end": 1211, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Policy_Studies_(Singapore)"}, {"start": 1226, "end": 1235, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 1438, "end": 1447, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 1629, "end": 1661, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_University_of_Singapore"}, {"start": 1735, "end": 1738, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"}, {"start": 1769, "end": 1782, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay_Round"}, {"start": 1832, "end": 1870, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Agreement_on_Tariffs_and_Trade"}, {"start": 1892, "end": 1895, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization"}, {"start": 1903, "end": 1912, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 1950, "end": 1964, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union"}, {"start": 2000, "end": 2009, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 2088, "end": 2097, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 2252, "end": 2256, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world"}, {"start": 2426, "end": 2435, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 2645, "end": 2654, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 2701, "end": 2710, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 2807, "end": 2818, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 2980, "end": 2989, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 3047, "end": 3056, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}, {"start": 3272, "end": 3281, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore"}]}, {"text": "Cuban novelist Jose Soler Puig dies at 79.

MANILA 1996-08-31 The detention of veteran dissident Wang Donghai showed China's determination to crush any vestige of dissent during the current profound transitions in the nation's leadership, a human rights activist said on Saturday. Xiao Qiang, executive director of the New York-based group Human Rights in China, said Wang's arrest on Friday appeared to be part of the national \"Strike Hard\" campaign that has imprisoned thousands and sent hundreds to their death. Although supposedly aimed at criminals, dozens of human rights activists have been detained in the campaign, which is meant to strengthen the Communist Party's grip on power as senior leader Deng Xiaoping nears death, Xiao said in an interview. \"China is going through this power transition period. The authorities are apparently extremely afraid of any political and social discontent,\" said Xiao, in Manila to attend an Amnesty International conference on human rights in China. He said one of Wang's apparent offences was to write a public letter in May suggesting that a free press and an independent judicial system were vital if the government really meant to stamp out rampant corruption. Xiao said crushing legitimate dissent was only making the problem worse and one day China would pay a high price. \"Those issues are not going to go away by repression. You only make things more hidden but potentially more explosive,\" he said. Wang was arrested in the east China city of Hangzhou by security officers who told the dissident's family he would be sent to a study class-- a euphemism for coercive ideological reform. Wang, 45, was sentenced last month to one year's \"re-education by labour\" but was released because of ill-health. Xiao said conditions in the labour camp were so brutal they drove another activist sentenced with Wang to attempt suicide.

Deborah Charles RANGOON 1996-08-31 Burma's democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi hit out at the government on Saturday for recent arrests and jailing of activists, saying the military abused the law to try to crush the democracy movement. \"The main purpose of this press conference is to make it known to the world that the authorities are misusing the law all the time in order to try to crush the democracy movement,\" Suu Kyi told reporters at her Rangoon home. Suu Kyi said at least 61 democracy supporters had been arrested since May, and about 30 of them had been sentenced, most to long prison terms. In May the government launched a sweeping crackdown on the democracy movement, detaining over 260 members of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) ahead of a party congress. Most were released but several dozen remain in custody. The Burmese government last week confirmed the recent sentencing of nine democracy activists who were arrested in the May crackdown, including Suu Kyi's assistant Win Htein. The military government, which in May said it had detained the politicians to prevent anarchy, said the activists were charged with attempting to destroy the peace and stability of the state. But Suu Kyi disagreed with the methods, saying officials often arrested NLD supporters in the middle of the night, then did not give them the opportunity to defend themselves in trials. \"When our people are tried, they are tried in a very secretive way. Their families are not told,\" she said. Suu Kyi, who spearheads a campaign for sanctions on Burma's government, was under house arrest for six years without being tried before being released in July 1995. Several other leading members of the NLD have served prison terms. The NLD party won a landslide victory in a 1990 election but the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), which assumed power in 1988 after crushing pro-democracy demonstrations, never recognised the poll. \"This lack of rule of law is an indication that the authorities are not interested in fair play,\" she said. \"They are using a travesty of the law to try and crush our movements and to sentence our people to long terms in prison without proper trial.\" Suu Kyi said once the activists were sentenced, they suffered inhuman conditions and lack of rights in prison. \"Almost all of the prisoners start suffering from various health problems after a couple of years in jail,\" she said. \"Some of our people have been in prison for five to six years.\" Most political prisoners are held in Rangoon's Insein Prison. Some who have been released have recounted torture methods like sleep and food deprivation and physical abuse. \"If there are any more instances of death in custody it will be further proof that a prison sentence for political prisoners is sometimes almost the same as a death sentence,\" Suu Kyi said. Hla Than, an elected member of parliament for the NLD, died in early August after being at Insein for six years. His death came five weeks after James Leander (Leo) Nichols, a close friend of Suu Kyi and Danish honorary consul, died while serving a prison term at Insein. Suu Kyi said the government had increased its repression tactics on the democracy movement because it feared the growing popularity of the movement. But she said she and the NLD would not stop their efforts to bring democracy to Burma even if it meant more arrests of party members or even herself. \"We will carry on. Nobody is free from arrest in Burma.\"", "value": [{"start": 0, "end": 5, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma"}, {"start": 8, "end": 15, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 64, "end": 71, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon"}, {"start": 83, "end": 88, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma"}, {"start": 108, "end": 124, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 464, "end": 471, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 494, "end": 501, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon"}, {"start": 508, "end": 515, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 760, "end": 767, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 770, "end": 799, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_for_Democracy"}, {"start": 893, "end": 900, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma"}, {"start": 1032, "end": 1039, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 1259, "end": 1266, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 1549, "end": 1556, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 1601, "end": 1606, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma"}, {"start": 1846, "end": 1885, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Peace_and_Development_Council"}, {"start": 2246, "end": 2253, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 2576, "end": 2583, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yangon"}, {"start": 2586, "end": 2599, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insein_Prison"}, {"start": 2888, "end": 2895, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 2993, "end": 2999, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insein_Township"}, {"start": 3094, "end": 3101, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 3106, "end": 3112, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark"}, {"start": 3166, "end": 3172, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insein_Township"}, {"start": 3174, "end": 3181, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi"}, {"start": 3403, "end": 3408, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma"}, {"start": 3522, "end": 3527, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma"}]}, {"text": "GOLF - THIRD ROUND OF JCPENNEY CLASSIC WASHED OUT.

They have occupied the area to the depth of 40 km (25 miles). They have established a headquarters in Chuman,\" Faik Nerweyi of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) told Reuters by telephone from Ankara. Nerweyi said he did not know the size or nature of the Iranian force in northern Iraq, but said KDP fighters had been easily outgunned in the area close to the Iranian border and had quickly withdrawn further west. \"They were far too strong,\" he said. Nerweyi said he did not know if there were any casualties. A U.N. official in Baghdad said the KDP, backed by Iraqi tanks, heavy artillery and helicopters had taken control of the main northern Iraqi city of Arbil after fighting on Saturday. U.S. President Bill Clinton has authorised the repositioning of U.S. firepower in the Gulf region in response to the Iraqi attacks. The KDP charges that the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, which took control of Arbil in fighting in December 1994, has backing from Iran. The PUK accuses the KDP of collaborating with Baghdad.

DETROIT 1996-08-31 Automakers, suppliers, insurers and the federal government's auto safety agency Saturday launched a $ 10 million safety awareness campaign aimed at reducing the number of children killed accidentally by air bags in cars and trucks. Officials said they will work with law enforcement agencies, pediatricians and media to warn parents about the dangers that air bags pose to children and adults not wearing seatbelts. Since 1993, 24 children have been killed by the explosive force of automotive air bags, which inflate at speeds up to 200 miles per hour. The first portion of the campaign involves pickup trucks equipped with billboards that were driving along some of the nation's busiest interstate highways during the Labor Day weekend, including Interstate 95 on the East Coast, Interstates 80 and 90 in the Midwest and Interstate 5 in California. The boards read : \"Air Bag Safety : Everyone Buckled, Kids in Back.\" Janet Dewey, executive director of the industry-funded National Automobile Occupant Protection Campaign, said most of the injuries to children occurred because they were not wearing seatbelts. A child's chances of being killed in a car accident, whether the vehicle was equipped with an air bag or not, is reduced by 29 percent when they are in the rear seat, she said. The auto industry was about three to six years away from introducing \"smart\" air bags with the ability to detect the size and position of an occupant and adjust inflation pressures accordingly. Current air bags were designed to halt the forward momentum of an average-sized, unbelted adult male, not a small child. Automakers petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to allow them to introduce air bags that inflate less aggressively to help reduce unwanted injuries. \"Even if changes are made to airbags today, we'd still have 20 million vehicles on the road with current technology,\" Dewey said. \"The public has n't been getting the message.\"", "value": [{"start": 12, "end": 16, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States"}, {"start": 49, "end": 56, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit"}, {"start": 788, "end": 797, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day"}, {"start": 817, "end": 830, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_95"}, {"start": 838, "end": 848, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States"}, {"start": 862, "end": 864, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_80"}, {"start": 869, "end": 871, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_90"}, {"start": 879, "end": 886, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States"}, {"start": 891, "end": 903, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_5_in_California"}, {"start": 907, "end": 917, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California"}, {"start": 1699, "end": 1745, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Highway_Traffic_Safety_Administration"}]}, {"text": "ALPINE SKIING-OFFICIALS HOPE TO SALVAGE WORLD CUP WEEKEND.

Jim Adams WASHINGTON 1996-08-31 More than 300 U.S. warplanes and 20 ships were available on Saturday in case President Bill Clinton ordered the use of U.S. force against Iraqi military action in northern Iraq, U.S. defense officials said. They said 200 fighter planes, including 79 on the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson, were already in the Gulf ; the aircraft carrier Enterprise was in the eastern Mediterranean with 79 more, and an air expeditionary force with up to 40 more was ready to fly from the United States if ordered. \"Yesterday the president ordered the Department of Defense to take prudent planning steps to have forces ready to deploy to the region should he direct us to do so,\" Pentagon spokesman Doug Kennett said. \"We have taken those prudent planning steps.\" Clinton said on Saturday he had ordered U.S. forces in the Gulf to go on high alert and was reinforcing them in response to Iraqi attacks on Kurdish dissidents in northern Iraq. \"These developments... cause me grave concern,\" Clinton said at a campaign stop in Troy, Tennessee. But he added, \"It is premature at this time, and I want to emphasize that, highly premature to speculate on any response we might have.\" The U.S. defense officials said military flights to enforce no-fly zones in both northern and southern Iraq doubled over the weekend. Clinton said Iraqi military forces overran the city of Arbil, which has been held since 1994 by Kurdish rebels who Baghdad says are backed by Iran. There were unconfirmed reports that Iran had sent troops into northern Iraq in response to Iraq's attack. U.S. plans rely heavily on U.S. air attacks on Iraqi forces, but there are also 23,000 U.S. troops in the region, according to defense officials. In addition to the 158 F / A-18, F-14 and other fighter planes on the aircraft carriers Vinson and Enterprise, the Air Force air expeditionary force of 30 to 40 F-15 and F-16 fighter planes and fuel tankers is ready to fly from three U.S. bases in the United States, they said. The expeditionary force would include nearly 1,000 Air Force personnel in ground and support crews, they said.

BONN 1996-08-31 Iranian security forces burst into the home of a German cultural attache in Tehran a month ago and seized his guests for questioning, Bonn's foreign ministry said on Saturday. A spokesman said he could substantially confirm a report in the news weekly Der Spiegel, which said Iranian secret police burst in while attache Jens Gust was entertaining six Iranian writers and their wives. Gust was threatened with violence, then locked into a room to be interrogated on suspicion of \"promoting activities hostile to the state\" while his guests were taken away, the magazine said. The ministry spokesman said the German embassy immediately made a sharp protest to the Tehran government. The Iranian ambassador was also summoned to the ministry in Bonn to hear a sharp protest and \"disapproval of this glaring breach of the principles of international law\", he added. Iran subsequently said it regretted the incident, which it said had been the result of a misunderstanding. All those detained appeared to have been freed, the spokesman said. Relations between the two countries are currently under strain because of the testimony in a Berlin court of former Iranian president Abolhassan Banisadr. Banisadr, an avowed opponent of the Tehran government who now lives in exile, accused top Iranian leaders of personally ordering the assassination of three exiled Kurdish leaders in a Berlin restaurant in 1992. Iran has asked Germany to extradite Banisadr, who is due is due back in Berlin next Thursday to continue his testimony. Banisadr, who received political asylum in France after fleeing there in 1981, told Der Spiegel he did not plan to ask for a guarantee of safe conduct.

Vera Haller VENICE, Italy 1996-08-31 Dublin-born director Neil Jordan says he never lost more sleep over a film than over \"Michael Collins\", his controversial epic about the IRA which has its premiere on Saturday at the Venice Film Festival. The film, starring Liam Neeson and Julia Roberts, recounts the life of Michael Collins, the Irish Republican Army's Director of Intelligence who fought for Irish independence from 1919 to 1921. Although not due for release in Britain until early next year, some politicians have already said they feared it would fan sectarian tensions in British-ruled Northern Ireland. Jordan defends his decision to make the film, whose screenplay he wrote himself after years of research, saying it was \"more about history than any political statement\". \"The film spares neither the Irish nor the British in its depiction of the savagery of the time,\" Jordan said in a statement released by Warner Bros. \"How often has independence been achieved without bloodshed? Very rarely.\" Jordan, whose 1992 film \"The Crying Game\" also came under fire for what was perceived as a sympathetic portrayal of the IRA, said Collins was more than just a revolutionary. \"He developed techniques of guerilla warfare later copied by independence movements around the world, from Mao Tse-Tung in China to Yitzak Shamir in Israel,\" Jordan said. \"Collins would never be a proponent of contemporary terrorism as practised today. He was a soldier and a statesman and, over time, a man of peace.\" Leeson, the Northern Ireland-born actor who was nominated for an Oscar for best actor for his performance in \"Schindler's List\", plays the lead role in Jordan's film. Aidan Quinn portrays Harry Boland, Collins ' best friend, and rival for the love of Kitty Kiernan, played by Roberts. Much of the film was shot on location in Dublin with Jordan using thousands of its citizens as unpaid extras. A set, however, was used for the fighting scenes. Noting that information about Collins was \"as mysterious as the existence he maintained\", Jordan said he made some historical assumptions in the film. \"I have made choices about certain events based on my own extensive research into his letters and reported speeches,\" he said. \"I wanted to make this a story as accurate as possible without killing it dramatically and I think I have. It is a very true film.\" One of the assumptions is his interpretation of the murky circumstances surrounding the shooting death of Collins, who had broken with his comrades when he sought a negotiated settlement with Britain, in an ambush in 1922. \"I have never lost more sleep over the making of a film than I have over ' Michael Collins ', but I'll never make a more important one,\" Jordan said. \"In the life of one person you can tell the events that formed the north and south of Ireland as they are today.\"", "value": [{"start": 14, "end": 17, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army"}, {"start": 35, "end": 41, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice"}, {"start": 64, "end": 70, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice"}, {"start": 72, "end": 77, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy"}, {"start": 110, "end": 121, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Jordan"}, {"start": 175, "end": 190, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_(film)"}, {"start": 226, "end": 229, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army"}, {"start": 272, "end": 292, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Film_Festival"}, {"start": 313, "end": 324, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Neeson"}, {"start": 329, "end": 342, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Roberts"}, {"start": 365, "end": 380, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_(Irish_leader)"}, {"start": 386, "end": 407, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army"}, {"start": 450, "end": 455, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland"}, {"start": 520, "end": 527, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 647, "end": 663, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland"}, {"start": 665, "end": 671, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Jordan"}, {"start": 864, "end": 869, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland"}, {"start": 878, "end": 885, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 933, "end": 939, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Jordan"}, {"start": 972, "end": 983, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros."}, {"start": 1060, "end": 1066, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Jordan"}, {"start": 1085, "end": 1100, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crying_Game"}, {"start": 1180, "end": 1183, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Republican_Army"}, {"start": 1190, "end": 1197, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_(Irish_leader)"}, {"start": 1341, "end": 1353, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mao_Zedong"}, {"start": 1357, "end": 1362, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China"}, {"start": 1366, "end": 1379, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Shamir"}, {"start": 1383, "end": 1389, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel"}, {"start": 1618, "end": 1623, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award"}, {"start": 1663, "end": 1679, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schindler's_List"}, {"start": 1720, "end": 1731, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aidan_Quinn"}, {"start": 1741, "end": 1753, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Boland"}, {"start": 1804, "end": 1817, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitty_Kiernan"}, {"start": 1879, "end": 1885, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin"}, {"start": 2514, "end": 2521, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_(Irish_leader)"}, {"start": 2600, "end": 2607, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom"}, {"start": 2706, "end": 2721, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_(Irish_leader)"}, {"start": 2867, "end": 2874, "tag": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland"}]}, {"text": "SOCCER - SCOTTISH LEAGUE AND CUP RESULTS.

After going four up in the first 55 minutes South Korea allowed Indonesia, newcomers to Asian Cup finals, back into the match, conceding two goals from rare counter attacks. Kim Do Hoon opened the scoring for South Korea in only the fifth minute, turning unmarked on the penalty spot to fire a shot into the top corner. It looked like turning into a rout as Hwang Sun Hong rapidly added two more in the seventh and 15th minutes but although the Koreans continued to dominate they failed to add to the score before the interval. But they started the second half where they had left off and it was not long before they went four up, Ko Jeong Woon heading in from a free kick in the 55th minute. The Koreans then appeared to relax, allowing the Indonesians to get back into the match. Ronny Wabia scored for Indonesia three minutes later direct from a a corner kick that Korean goalkeeper Kim Byung reached with one hand but failed to keep out.

DUBLIN 1996-12-07 Jack Charlton's relationship with the people of Ireland was cemented on Saturday when the Englishman was officially declared one of their own. Charlton, 61, and his wife, Peggy, became citizens of Ireland when they formally received Irish passports from deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring who said the honour had been made in recognition of Charlton's achievements as the national soccer manager. \"The years I spent as manager of the Republic of Ireland were the best years of my life. It all culminated in the fact that I now have lots of great, great friends in Ireland. That is why this is so emotional a night for me,\" Charlton said. \"It was the joy that we all had over the period, that I shared with people that I grew to love, that I treasure most,\" he added. Charlton managed Ireland for 93 matches, during which time they lost only 17 times in almost 10 years until he resigned in December 1995. He guided Ireland to two successive World Cup finals tournaments and to the 1988 European championship finals in Germany, after the Irish beat a well-fancied England team 1-0 in their group qualifier.
