brewer
Zywiec
's
1996
profit
slump
may
last
into
next

due
in
part
to
hefty
depreciation
charges
,
but
recent
high

should
help
the

defend
its
10-percent

,
the

said

*NL*
Company
President
Jean

told
MMSTART_18998750	Reuters
Reuters
MMEND
in
an

on

that
the

,
whose
net
profit
fell
77
percent
in
the
first
10
months
of
1996
despite
a
30-percent
rise
in

,
might
only
post
slightly
better
profits
in

before
having
a
chance
to
make
a
more
significant
turnaround
.
*NL*
So

this

Zywiec

whose

netted
six
million

of
224

zlotys
.
*NL*
It
has
produced
1.5
million
hectolitres
.
*NL*
Van
Boxmeer
would
not
say
how
much
higher
1997
profits
or
market
share
could
be
but
said
sales
of
leading
MMSTART_22936	Poland
Polish
MMEND
brewers
should
rise
as
the
country
's
young
urban
professionals
gradually
switch
from
vodka
to
beer
.
*NL*
"
The
perspective
on
growth
is
such
that
reasonably
we
can
think
that
somewhere
between
65

80

is
certainly
reachable

*NL*

the

could
be
reached
in

make

Poland
MMEND
's
top
five
brewers
,
which
produce
about
55
percent
of
the
country
's

,
could
all
raise
market
share
as
some
of
the
numerous
small

fall
to
competition
from
the
large

with
foreign

Earlier
this

Elbrewery

.
*NL*
Van
Boxmeer
said
the
tough
competition
had
prevented
Zywiec
from
raising
prices
in
line
with
inflation
,
which
had
added
to
the
pressure
on
the
firm
's
margins
.
*NL*
He
said
advertising
costs
would
also
increase
in
the
fight
for
market
share
.
*NL*
But
he
said
the
company
's
investment
of
more
than
$
100
million
already
this
decade
,
largely
in
production
,
would
help
position
it
to
compete
with
such
competitors
as
brewers
from
the
neighbouring
MMSTART_5321	Czech_Republic
Czech
Republic
MMEND
.
*NL*
Some
analysts
say
cheaper

high-quality
MMSTART_5321	Czech_Republic
Czech

imports
could
invade

MMEND
once
tariffs

MMSTART_459244	Central_European_Free_Trade_Agreement
CEFTA
MMEND
countries

,
but
van
Boxmeer
says
such
a
threat
might
be
exaggerated
despite
the
MMSTART_5321	Czech_Republic
Czech
MMEND
beer
market
's
overcapacity
.
*NL*
"
I
think
MMSTART_22936	Poland
Polish
MMEND
consumers
in
general
are
quite
proud
of
their
beers
--
and
I
'm
speaking
about
all
the

--
and
as
we
make
good
beers
...
*NL*
I
think
that
this
fidelity
to
our
beers
is
a
factor
which
can
limit
the
MMSTART_5321	Czech_Republic
Czech
MMEND
beers
,
"
he
said
.
*NL*
Van
Boxmeer
said
Zywiec
had
its
eye
on
Okocim
,
which
has
said
it
would
start
producing
MMSTART_325070	Carlsberg_Group
Carlsberg
MMEND
beer
next
year
,
but
that
Zywiec
's
potential
production
of
MMSTART_4793292	Heineken
Heineken
MMEND
was
a
medium-term
possibility
rather
than
a
short-term
one
.
*NL*
He
said
his
firm
would
be
better
off
concentrating
on
its
leading
brand
,
Zywiec
Full
Light
,
which
accounts
for
85
percent
of
sales
and
is
the
country
's
largest-selling
brand
.
*NL*
"
You
will
not
win
the
war
of
the
MMSTART_22936	Poland

beer
market
with
imported
international
brands
,
"
van
Boxmeer
said
,
adding
that
MMSTART_4793292	Heineken

MMEND
would
remain
an
up-market
import
in
MMSTART_22936	Poland
Poland
MMEND
.
*NL*
Van
Boxmeer
also
said
Zywiec
would
be
boosted
by
its
recent
shedding
of
soft
drinks
which
only
accounted
for
about
three
percent
of
the
firm
's
overall
sales
and
for
which
7.6

in

had
already

A

explained
that
Goldman

,
which
this

proposed
the

By

,
the

adding
that

.
*NL*
The

in

sold
its

a

that
it
says
saved
it
$

costs

it
has
been
trying

build

this

The

30

Farid

the

The

--
by
80

from
8,000

Hakme

*NL*
"
We
believe
the
increase

results
from

*NL*
People

*NL*
A
controlled

trade
liberalisation

tight

also
dramatically
curbed

attributes
MMSTART_3383	Brazil
Brazil
MMEND
's
fascination
with

not

to

is
the

"
he

*NL*
MMSTART_3383	Brazil
Brazil
MMEND
's
most
sought-after
beauty
treatment
is
liposuction
in
which
fat
is
sucked
away
from
areas
of
the
body
,
with
about
30,000
operations
a
year
at
a
cost
of
$
3,000
to
$
4,000
each
.
*NL*
Stomach
tucks
and
breast
operations
are
also
popular
since
the
tropical
climate
calls
for
flesh-baring
fashions
,
but
unlike
women
elsewhere
MMSTART_3383	Brazil
Brazilians
MMEND
tend
to
have
breast
reductions
and
buttock
implants
.
*NL*
"
The

synthetic

MMEND
's
tight-lipped
central
bank
chief
and
an
influential
top
bureaucrat
are
further
signs
that
the
nation
's
authorities
want
to
keep
the
dollar
at
current
levels
,
market
sources
said
on
Friday
.
*NL*
In
a
rare
expression
of
a
view
on

by
the

Bank
of

MMEND
(

Japan
MMEND
's
leading
economic
daily
on
Friday
as
saying
that
he
sees
no
further
,
immediate
fall
in

.
*NL*
This
followed
a
widely
watched
television
appearance
late
on
Thursday
by
Eisuke

,
a
high-ranking
MMSTART_870389	Ministry_of_Finance_(Japan)

MMEND
official
,
who
denied
he
had
said
he
wants
to
guide
the
dollar
lower
to
between
108
and
110
yen
.
*NL*
But
many
in
the
market
thought
Sakakibara
's
real
intentions
lay
elsewhere
,
and
took
more
notice
of
his
comments
about
the
MMSTART_3434750	United_States
U.S.
MMEND
government
's
stance
on
the
dollar
,

*NL*

It

*NL*
In

sense
,
the

are
not
pointing
to

"
he
said

*NL*
"
It

:
"
Maybe
a

is
not
acceptable

to

it

at

*NL*
Market
participants
have
kept
a
close
eye
on
Sakakibara
,
chief
of
the
ministry
's
International

Bureau
,
as
a
comment
he
made
in
November
after
the
dollar
hit
this
year
's
high
of
114.92
yen
pushed
the
currency
down
sharply
.
*NL*
He
had
said
then
that
the
market
's
view
on
MMSTART_15573	Japan
Japan
MMEND
's
economy
was
too
pessimistic
and
that
he
believed
it
was
stronger
than
the

thought
.
*NL*
Dealers
have
come
to
refer
to
115
yen
as
the
"
Sakakibara
ceiling
"
for
the

following
the
remark
.
*NL*
Adding
to
the
comments
by
"
Mr

"
,
as
Sakakibara
is
known
for
his
prominence
in

market
,
was

governor
Matsushita
's
remark
.
*NL*
"
The
recent
level
of

has
been
stable
,
and
it
does
not
appear
to
be
moving
towards
a
further
depreciation
of

immediately
,
so
import

are
likely
to
stabilise

interview
with

Shimbun
MMEND
.
*NL*
"
The
fact
that

groups

staid

made
a

stab
on

*NL*
But
critics
at

revise

in

said
the

might
as

be
trying

police

*NL*
After
four
days
of
diplomatic
wrangling
over

,
some
600
delegates
from

small

got
down

the

setting
the

*NL*
Cyberspace
squabbles
overshadowed
the

the

a

*NL*

announced

*NL*
Attempts
by
copyright-based
industries
to
ensure
they
get
a
cut
from

led
to
a
storm
of
protests
by

MMEND
companies
and
critics
who
say
the
pacts
would
curb

At

are
billions

the

of

--
the
coming
medium
for
the
distribution
of

*NL*
Supporters
of
the
three
pacts
say
they
are
only
an
extension
of
existing
intellectual
property
rights
,
covered
by
the
century-old
Berne
Convention
.
*NL*
But
an
array
of
opponents
from
the
network
industry
to
consumer

scientific

say
the
pacts
will
give
sweeping

the

ought
to
be
held
where
the
MMSTART_33873	World_Trade_Organization
WTO
MMEND
was
going
to
be
headquartered
.
*NL*
That
would
have
meant
MMSTART_12521	Geneva
Geneva
MMEND
.
*NL*
But
MMSTART_27318	Singapore
Singapore
MMEND
had
the
support
of
other

.

Derek

senior
fellow
at
the

MMEND
(

)
,
said
MMSTART_27318	Singapore
Singapore
MMEND
's
hosting
of
the
conference
"
carries
a
great
deal
of
symbolism
for
the
city-state
,
underscoring
its
commitment
to
free
trade
and
its
trading
links
across
the
globe
.
"
*NL*
There
is
the
international
prestige
MMSTART_27318	Singapore
Singapore
MMEND
would
enjoy
,
but
"
more
importantly
there
is
a
genuine
national
interest
in
fostering
better
global
free
trade
and
an
open
market
"
,
said
Tan
Kong
Yam
,
head
of

at
the
MMSTART_286880	National_University_of_Singapore
National
University
of
Singapore
MMEND
.
*NL*
At
the
ministerial
meeting
,
trade
ministers
will
review
the
work
of
the
MMSTART_33873	World_Trade_Organization
WTO
MMEND
and
the
implementation
of
the
MMSTART_31843	Uruguay
Uruguay
MMEND
Round
free
trade
commitments
under
its
predecessor
the
General
Agreement
on
Tariffs

(

.
*NL*
In
June
,
the
MMSTART_33873	World_Trade_Organization
WTO
MMEND
hailed
MMSTART_27318	Singapore
Singapore
MMEND
for
its
open
market
policies
but
the
MMSTART_9317	European_Union
European
Union
MMEND
and
other
trading
powers
called
on
MMSTART_27318	Singapore
Singapore
MMEND
to
speed
up
the
opening
of
its
services
sector
.
*NL*
Supple
said
the
struggle
that
MMSTART_27318	Singapore
Singapore
MMEND
had
to
wage
in
vying
to
host
the
meeting
would
be
repeated
during
the
talks
.
*NL*
"
There
is
tension
at
every
step
of
the
way
,
"
since
a
battle
line
between
the
West
and
developing
countries
has
been
drawn
over
the
issue
of
linking
trade
liberalisation
with
labour
rights
,
he
said
.
*NL*
Supple
said
hosting
the
meeting
carried
prestige
for
MMSTART_27318	Singapore
Singapore
MMEND
,
"
however
,
this
is
quite
intangible
as
the
prestige
factor
may
not
necessarily
lead
to
any
additional
investment
and
trade
flows
to
this
region
.
"
*NL*
From
a
commercial
point
of
view
,
the
meeting
would
be
good
for
MMSTART_27318	Singapore
Singapore
MMEND
's
tourism
industry
,
Tan
said
.
*NL*
A
large
part
of
MMSTART_27318	Singapore
Singapore
MMEND
's
workforce
would
be
mobilised
to
ensure
the
meeting
would
run
without
a
glitch
but
the
average
Singaporean
"
would
probably
not
be
too
concerned
about
some
of
the
issues
,
"
Tan
said
.
*NL*
"
But
the
more
educated
public
will
realise
that
these
kind
of
things
are
important
for
MMSTART_27318	Singapore
Singapore
MMEND
as
a
small
economy
.
"
*NL*
Supple
said
any
political
gains
the
MMSTART_27318	Singapore
Singapore
MMEND
government
would
get
from
the
MMSTART_33873	World_Trade_Organization
WTO
MMEND
meeting
--
ahead
of
a
general
election
due
by
April
1997
--
would
depend
on
how
successful
it
was
in
pushing
its
economic
agenda
.
*NL*
"
If
there
are
any
movements
toward
freer
trade
,
then
MMSTART_27318	Singapore
Singapore
MMEND
's
economy
and
the
electorate
would
gain
,
"
he
said
.
"
*NL*
But
I
do
n't
think
it
would
be
wise
to
play
up
the
political
aspect
of
this
.
*NL*
I
think
political
issues
will
take
secondary
importance
to
all
these
economic
issues
that
will
be
displayed
.

on

that
it

The

the

told

the

plans
to

three
firms
under
a
holding
company
,
but
did
not
specify
when
the
restructuring
would
likely
take
effect
.
*NL*
One
of
the
three
new
companies
will
be
a
long-distance

and
the
other
two
will
be
local-call

,
Horinouchi

One

,
Horinouchi
said

*NL*
The
NTT
official
said
the
timing
of
the
planned
split-up
was
uncertain
because
more

by

were
required

For

,
Friday

were
cancelled
due
to
heavy
wet

Organisers
hope

that

in
on
Saturday
morning
,
conditions
permitting
,
and
stage
the

later
in

"
There
was

possibility
today
to

"
said
Bernd
Zobel
,
the
Canadian
men
's
national
coach
,
citing
too
much
new
snow
and
poor
visibility
.
*NL*
If
organisers
are
forced
to
run
the
downhill
on
Sunday
,
the
super-giant

originally
scheduled

would
