Franz

MMEND
to
ban

his
proposal
after
the

European

agreed
this

MMEND
had
proposed
banning

brains

spleens

MMEND
that

*NL*
But
some

questioned
whether
the

necessary
given
the

*NL*
The

The

They

given
900

either

those

under
many
MMSTART_25391	Russia
Russian
MMEND
barter
deals
,
with
nothing
imported
in

.
*NL*
She
said
the
cost
of
such
unimported
goods
was
$
1.10
billion
in
1995
.
*NL*
Barter
deals
were
worth
$
4.9
billion
last
year
,
or
about
eight
percent
of
all
MMSTART_25391	Russia
Russian
MMEND
exports
estimated
at
$
61.5
billion
,
she
said
.
*NL*
"
The
cost
of

is
too
often
understated
,
so
the
actual
share
of
barter
deals
in
MMSTART_25391	Russia
Russian
MMEND
exports
and
the
amount
of

may

Volkova

A
few
days
ago
MMSTART_25391	Russia
Russian
MMEND
President
MMSTART_23278520	Boris_Yeltsin
Boris

MMEND
issued
a
decree
on
state
regulation
of
foreign
barter

,
and
Volkova
said
this
"
could
substantially
improve
the
situation
"
.
*NL*
In
line
with
the
decree
,
which
will
come
into
force
on
November
1
,
all
MMSTART_25391	Russia
Russian
MMEND
barter
traders
will
be
obliged
to
import
goods
worth
the
cost
of
their
exports
within
180
days
.
*NL*
"
If

are
late
,
they
will
have
to
pay
fines
worth
the

their
exported
goods
,
"
Volkova
said
.
*NL*
Understating
the
cost
of
exported
goods
could
still
be
a
loophole
for

dealers
,
but
Volkova
said
the
authorities
are
currently
"
tackling

the
issue

Barter

but
MMSTART_23278520	Boris_Yeltsin
Yeltsin
MMEND
's
decrees
liberalising
foreign
trade
in
1991-1992
has
given
barter
a
new
impetus
.
*NL*
A
few
years
ago
,
barter
deals
accounted
for
up
to
25-30
percent
of
MMSTART_25391	Russia
Russian
MMEND
exports
because
"
thousands
(
of
)
trade
companies
which

up
preferred
barter
in
the
absence
of
reliable
MMSTART_25391	Russia
Russian

banks
and

transfer
systems
"
,
Volkova
said
.
*NL*
"
Now
many
MMSTART_25391	Russia
Russian

are
strong
and
can
make
various

longer-dated

the

now
perhaps

sell
some

buy
some
long

,
"
he
said
.
*NL*
"
Long
dated
volatility
has
been
low
this

so
it

still

*NL*
"
It

You

"
*NL*
He

volatility

Paribas

OTC

Robert

said
that
if
volatility
continued
lower
for
the
rest
of
Friday
in
over-the-counter
10-year
Bunds
,
it
should
be
higher
next
Tuesday
.
*NL*
He
said
the
absence
on
holiday
of
many
market
makers
was
a
main
factor
behind
falls
this

in
volatility
in
high-yielding
markets
such

Spain
MMEND

MMSTART_5058739	Sweden
Sweden
MMEND
.
*NL*
Coughlan
said
the
market
had
more
downside
than
upside
potential
,
but
a
fall
was
not
likely
to
be
of
significant
size
.
*NL*
"
I
recommend
people
sell
strangles
in

--
in
MMSTART_11867	Germany
Germany
MMEND

MMSTART_5843419	France
France
MMEND
in

.
*NL*
"
With

MMSTART_14532	Italy
Italy
MMEND

fronts

so
I
would
use
current
the

buy
options

*NL*
"
So

Up
to
100,000
tonnes
of
copper
held
in
MMSTART_27643	Shanghai
Shanghai
MMEND
bonded
warehouses
,
confounding
the
world
market
as
to
its
source
and
ultimate
fate
,
probably
belongs
to
MMSTART_5405	China
China
MMEND
's
strategic
state
reserve
,
industry
sources
said
on
Friday
.
*NL*
Around
40,000
tonnes
of
the
copper
have
already
been
moved
to
warehouses
near
the
northern
port
of
MMSTART_1331885	Yingkou
Yingkou
MMEND
,
where
some
of
the
strategic
stockpile
was
stored
,
they
said
.
*NL*
Just
who
owns
the
copper
is
a
question
that
has
kept
traders
and
industry
analysts
guessing
since
the
metal
was
channelled
into
MMSTART_27643	Shanghai
Shanghai
MMEND
by
the
China
National
Nonferrous
Metals
Import
and
Export
Corp
(
CNIEC
)
in
June
and
July
.
*NL*
It
was
unclear
whether
or
not
the
40,000
tonnes
had
cleared
customs
--
which
would
provide
some
concrete
indication
that
the
strategic
reserve
,
administered
directly
by
the
central
government
's
State
Planning
Commission
,
owned
the
copper
.
*NL*
Traders
have
said
the
reserve
could
negotiate
concessions
on
duties
--
three
percent
import
tax
and
17
percent
value-added
tax
--
that
made
the
copper
prohibitively
expensive
otherwise
.
*NL*
But
one
source
,
the
head
of
a
MMSTART_13404	Hong_Kong
Hong
Kong
MMEND
trading
house
,
said
it
made
no
difference
if
the
copper
was
customs
cleared
or
not
.
*NL*
"
If
they
spend
all
this
money
moving
the
copper
to
MMSTART_1331885	Yingkou
Yingkou
MMEND
,
it
will
be
sitting
there
for
years
,
"
he
said
.
*NL*
"
Once
it
arrives
in
MMSTART_1331885	Yingkou
Yingkou
MMEND
,
it
is
subject
to
monitoring
by
the
State
Planning
Commission
,
which
has
to
give
permission
for
any
more
movement
;
it
is
out
of
the
hands
of
traders
,
"
he
said
.
*NL*
Mystery
has
surrounded
the
MMSTART_27643	Shanghai
Shanghai
MMEND
stockpile
in
recent
months
,
with
traders
unsure
not
only
of
who
owns
it
,
but
of
its
exact
size
and
what
its
owner
planned
to
do
with
it
.
*NL*
Trading
sources
generally
agreed
it
would
be
cost-effective
to
take
the
copper
back
into
a
depleted
central
reserve
as
it
had
already
served
its
purpose
in
taking
advantage
of
long-term
backwardation
on
the
MMSTART_223968	London_Metal_Exchange
London
Metal
Exchange
MMEND
(
LME
)
.
*NL*
A
backwardation
occurs
when
the
spot
price
of
a
metal
is
higher
than
the
forward
price
.
*NL*
CNIEC
lent
around
85,000
tonnes
of
copper
onto
the
LME
between
April
and
June
1995
on
behalf
of
the
state
reserve
,
running
the
state
stockpile
down
to
115,000
tonnes
from
200,000
tonnes
previously
.
*NL*
Traders
in
MMSTART_689	Asia
Asia
MMEND
said
CNIEC
could
well
have
lent
it
to
the
market
at
around
MMSTART_18717338	United_States_dollar
US$
MMEND
2,700
a
tonne
,
and
then
paid
somewhere
between
$
2,200
and
$
2,400
a
tonne
when
it
started
taking
the
metal
back
earlier
this
year
.
*NL*
This
would
have
cleared
CNIEC
a
healthy
profit
,
which
could
then
have
been
used
to
finance
storage
and
other
costs
.
*NL*
Word
that
CNIEC
had
offered
the
copper
to
MMSTART_9239	Europe
European
MMEND
trading
houses
in

unnerved

*NL*
Industry

said
on
Wednesday
the
motivation
of
the
owners
of
the
85,000
tonnes
,
"
whoever
they
are
,
is
the
most
important
short-term
fundamental
"
in

already
tight
world

.

after
it
revealed

Shanghai
MMEND
bonded

.
*NL*
They
reported
more

that

.
*NL*
They
also
expressed
concern
that
the
tonnage
in
bonded

would
move
onto
the
domestic
market
.
*NL*
But
these
concerns
were
irrelevant
,
a
MMSTART_27318	Singapore
Singapore
MMEND
trader
said
,
despite
a
forecast
that
domestic
MMSTART_5405	China
Chinese
MMEND
copper
demand
could
hit
one
million
tonnes
this
year
.
*NL*
As
with

,
"
there
is
a
desire
(
by
the
MMSTART_5405	China
Chinese
MMEND
government
)
to
keep
a
stockpile
of
the
metal
,
"
he
said
.
"
*NL*
You
do
n't
keep
it
to

,
you
keep
it

*NL*
One
feature
of

Java
MMEND
language
is
that
small
software

they
are
small
applications
,
can
be
downloaded
from
the
server
computers
at
the
centre
of
networks
onto
individual
computers
for
use
.
*NL*
In
this
model
,
individual
computer
users
can
always
gain
access
to
the
latest
programmes
and
do
not
need
to
store
more
software
than
they
are
currently
using
on
their
computers
at
any
one
time

also
saving
costs

A

Lewis
,
dropped
as
a
disciplinary
measure
after
arriving
only
35
minutes
before
the
start

,
provided
the
only
bright
spot
for

as
the

a

run

attempting

where

.

There
seemed
scant

until
the

swooped
on

Rain
arrived

again

's

commission
begins

this

in
a

political
rationales
and
find
the
sinister
figures
who
have
the
blood
of
the
country
's
race
war
on
their

.
*NL*
Leaders
of
the
major
parties
involved
,
from
right-wing
whites
to
radical

,
appeared
before
Archbishop
MMSTART_8401973	Desmond_Tutu
Desmond
Tutu
MMEND
's
Truth
and
Reconciliation
Commission
last

to
paint
the
broad
picture
of
their
actions
for
or
against
apartheid
.
*NL*
Most
,
including
former

MMSTART_11479	F._W._de_Klerk

,
offered
apologies
for
any
mistakes
they
had
made
and
accepted
broad
responsibility
for
the
actions
of
their
foot
soldiers
.
*NL*
But
none
named
those
guilty
of
ordering
or
carrying
out
any
of
the
gross
violations
of
human
rights
which
MMSTART_8401973	Desmond_Tutu
Tutu
MMEND
is
investigating
.
*NL*
Human
rights
lawyer
MMSTART_14059389	Brian_Currin
Brian
Currin
MMEND
said
the
hearings
last
week
were
not
intended
as
a
form
of
confessional
and
that
those
who
personally
committed
crimes
during
apartheid
would
testify
only
before
a
separate
arm
of
the
commission
,
the
amnesty
committee
.
*NL*
"
I
do
n't
think
one
should
have
expected
more
than
what
one
got
,
"
he
said
.
"
*NL*
That
was
not
the
amnesty
committee
where
perpetrators
are
expected
to
open
their
hearts
and
souls
and
to
tell
it
all
.
"
*NL*
The
commission
,
which
has
the
power
to
grant
amnesty
to
those
who
confess
to
abuses
,
has
begun
hearing
the
testimony
from
people
already
in
jail
for
their
deeds
.
*NL*
But
others
,
such
as
self-confessed
secret
police
hit-squad
leader
MMSTART_11288911	Dirk_Coetzee
Dirk
Coetzee
MMEND
,
have
yet
to
testify
.
*NL*
MMSTART_8401973	Desmond_Tutu
Tutu
MMEND
's
deputy
chairman
,
Alex
Boraine
,
told
reporters
the
commission
would
begin
issuing
subpoenas
to
suspects
who
refused
to
appear
voluntarily
some
time
this
week
.
*NL*
He
added
that
former
hardline
apartheid
president
MMSTART_383252	P._W._Botha
P.W.
Botha
MMEND
could
be
among
those
called
.
*NL*
But
MMSTART_14059389	Brian_Currin
Currin
MMEND
,
who
is
advising
several
people
regarded
as
perpetrators
,
said
this
was
not
the
best
way
to
achieve
the
commission
's
aims
.
*NL*
"
A
person
can
be
forced
to
appear
,
but
the
only
way
one
is
going
to
get
to
the
truth
in
its
totality
is
if
people
feel
it
is
a
good
idea
to
go
to
the
amnesty
committee
.
*NL*
At
the
moment
this
is
not
the
case
.
"
*NL*
He
cited
MMSTART_11288911	Dirk_Coetzee
Coetzee
MMEND
,
who
was
charged
with
murder
after
confessing
in
media
interviews
to
dirty
tricks
.
*NL*
His
trial
is
due
to
start
in
December
but
the
truth
commission
intends
to
decide
on
his
amnesty
application
before
that
.
*NL*
MMSTART_14059389	Brian_Currin
Currin
MMEND
said
the
law
had
to
be

The

showed

rather

*NL*
Presently
,
for

if

he

said

,
a
MMSTART_8706816	Towers_Perrin

*NL*
In
the

the

will
be

solely

"

"
she
said
.
*NL*
In

the

have

work
well
in

,
be

*NL*
Of
the
750
mid-to-large
size
corporations
surveyed
,
81
percent
had
undergone
a
major
restructuring
in
the
last
three
years
,
and
more
than
two-thirds
reported
that
productivity
and
profits
were
up
as
result
.
*NL*
Next
on
the
agenda
for
these
firms
is
developing
a
new
compensation
structure
,
and
78
percent
report
that
they
are
considering
a
new
,
skills-based
plan
for
both
management
and
non-management
employees
.
*NL*
This
coming
shift
,
O'Neal
said
,
"
is
not
just
isolated
or
a
fad
.
*NL*
It
's
an
inexorable
change
.
"
*NL*
After
MMSTART_32927	World_War_II
World
War
II
MMEND
,
corporations
adopted
a
"
military
model
"
creating
hierarchical
organisations
where
"
the
concept
of
defined
tasks
worked
great
,
"
she
said
.
*NL*
But
as
the
economy
became
global
,
customers
were
more
demanding
and
problems
became
more
complex
.
*NL*
"
Multi-layers
kept
management
at
a
distance
from
its
customers
,
"
O'Neal
said
.
*NL*
Now
organisations
must
change
to
stay
competitive
.
*NL*
O'Neal
says
firms
will
place
a
greater
emphasis
on
teams
and
team
performance
in
giving
raises
.
*NL*
If
your
team
does
well
,
you
'll
do
well
.
*NL*
If
it
does
n't
do
well
,
do
n't
expect
a
raise
.
*NL*
Is
this
fair
to
an
employee
who
can
go
the
distance
but
is
on
a
team
that
ca
n't
keep
up
?
*NL*
"
That
's
an
important
question
we
used
to
ask
a
lot
,
"
said
O'Neal
.
"
*NL*
It
's
not
a
question
we
ask
any
more
.
*NL*
The
more
important
question
is
--
'
Do
we
have
results
?
'
*NL*
"
*NL*
To
get
those
results
,
27
percent
of
the
companies
surveyed
plan
to
eliminate
base
pay
increases
in
favour
of
cash
bonuses
and
incentives
,
such
as
employee
and
team
award
programmes
and
education
.
*NL*
Companies
that
can
change
their
culture
and
view
employees
as
business
partners
will
do
well
,
O'Neal
said
.
*NL*
For
example
,
the
survey
rated
some
participants
in
the
survey
as
"
high-performing
"
companies
,
based
on
their
return
on
equity
above
16
percent
.
*NL*
Those
companies
also
said
they
already
offer
employees
variable
pay
and
business
education
,
give
their
managers
more
control
over
pay
decisions
and
celebrate
employee
and
team
success
.
*NL*
"
They
respect
employees
more
,
they
trust
employees
more
and
they
value
their
employees
more
,
"
O'Neal
said
.
*NL*
"
The
key
to
success
at
high-performance
companies
is
engaging
employees
in
a
business
partnership
.
*NL*
It

"
Happily
the

*NL*
The
most
obvious
one
with

at

Gilbertson

*NL*
Implats

*NL*
Not

it

*NL*
But

*NL*
"

*NL*
From

Looking

the

of
Gencor

stake
in

Malbak

one

"
We

of

*NL*
Overall

leaving

Gilbertson

*NL*
He
added
that
the

still
had
about
85

*NL*
Referring
to

Gilbertson

the

would
wait

*NL*
"
I

Kafelnikov

had

*NL*
At

attended

approximately
50
players
on

player
MMSTART_871725	Todd_Martin
Todd
Martin
MMEND
expressed
the
players
'
outrage
at
the
seedings
.
*NL*
"
The
way
the
MMSTART_82729	US_Open_(tennis)
U.S.
Open
MMEND
has
seeded
here
,
tampering
with
the
ranking
system
,
has
tarnished
the
image
and
reputation
of
this
MMSTART_82729	US_Open_(tennis)
U.S.
Open
MMEND
in
the
players
'
mind
,
and
we
think
that
is
damaging
to
our
sport
,
"
MMSTART_871725	Todd_Martin
Martin
MMEND
said
.
*NL*
MMSTART_979088	Michael_Stich
Stich
MMEND
said
he
felt
the
players
ought
to
have
organised
an
active
protest
.
*NL*
"
I
feel
that
we
made
it
a
little
easy
for
the
MMSTART_1178132	United_States_Tennis_Association
USTA
MMEND
.
*NL*
They
did
n't
really
get
hurt
as
much
as
I
think
they
should
have
,
"
said
MMSTART_979088	Michael_Stich
Stich
MMEND
.
"
*NL*
I
feel
that
we
should
have
maybe
just
cancelled
out
the
Monday
,
not
show
up
today
and
start
the
tournament
tomorrow
.
"
*NL*
But
once
the
27-year-old
MMSTART_979088	Michael_Stich
Stich
MMEND
got
on
the
court
,
he
focused
his
energies
on
trying
to
win
the
year
's
last
MMSTART_197638	Grand_Slam_(tennis)
Grand
Slam
MMEND
.
*NL*
He
took
a
positive
first
step
with
his
6-3
1-6
6-1
7-5
win
over
compatriot
MMSTART_1118005	Tommy_Haas

MMEND
on
a

Spain
MMEND
,
who
will
be
MMSTART_979088	Michael_Stich

's
next
opponent
.
*NL*
The
suspicion
,
however
,
lingers
in
MMSTART_979088	Michael_Stich
Stich
MMEND
's
mind
that
MMSTART_82729	US_Open_(tennis)
U.S.
Open
MMEND
officials
did
tamper
with
the
seeding
process
in
order
to
benefit
homegrown
players
.
*NL*
"
I
get
the
feeling
that
everything
is
done
here
for
the
MMSTART_3434750	United_States
American
MMEND
players
and
they
forget
about
all
the
other
players
,
"
said
MMSTART_979088	Michael_Stich
Stich
MMEND
,
who
lost
the
1994
Open
final
to
MMSTART_595	Andre_Agassi
Andre
Agassi
MMEND
.
*NL*
It
was
MMSTART_595	Andre_Agassi
Agassi
MMEND
who
was
at
the
centre
of
the
controversy
that
engulfed
the
tournament
since
the
original
draw
was
completed
on
Wednesday
.
*NL*
The
flamboyant
MMSTART_3434750	United_States
American
MMEND
star
was
bumped
up
two
spots
from
his
MMSTART_627107	Association_of_Tennis_Professionals
ATP
MMEND
ranking
of
eight
to
a
seeding
of
six
.
*NL*
"
He
(
MMSTART_595	Andre_Agassi
Agassi
MMEND
)
should
be
seeded
the
way
he
is
playing
tennis
right
now
,
"
said
MMSTART_979088	Michael_Stich
Stich
MMEND
about
the
unfairness
of
moving
up
MMSTART_595	Andre_Agassi
Agassi
MMEND
,
who
made
early
exits
from
the
MMSTART_147724	French_Open
French

MMEND
and
MMSTART_91195	The_Championships,_Wimbledon
Wimbledon

*NL*
MMSTART_979088	Michael_Stich
Stich
MMEND
,
not
seeded
here
for
the
first
time
since
1990
,
might
have
benefitted
from
some
fiddling
with
the
seedings
himself
after
MMSTART_489963	Yevgeny_Kafelnikov
Kafelnikov
MMEND
withdrew
.
*NL*
Ranked
18th
in
the
world
,
MMSTART_979088	Michael_Stich

MMEND
might

spot
ahead
of

Spain
MMEND
's
MMSTART_1723559	Félix_Mantilla_Botella
Felix
Mantilla
MMEND
,
who
is
16th
but
had
never
been
played
in

and
had
been
left
out
of

originally
.
*NL*
But
MMSTART_979088	Michael_Stich
Stich
MMEND
did
n't
want

"

clear
himself

In

September

would

in

the

"
I
do
often
hear
on

of

As

Expectations
that
Cofinec
S.A.
,
the
MMSTART_13275	Hungary
Hungarian
MMEND
bourse
's
first
foreign
listing
,
will
report
a
disappointing
first
half
have
depressed
the
stock
below
its
issue
price
,
but
analysts
expect
a
rebound
in
the
long
term
.
*NL*
"
The
first
half
of
the
year
is
unlikely
to
be
as
strong
as
expected
so
the
company
will
probably
be
unable
to
reach
its
annual
plan
in
1996
,
"
said
Gabor
Sitanyi
,
a
London-based
analyst
for
ING
Barings
.
*NL*
The
French-registered
packaging
materials
company
,
which
floated
its
shares
in
MMSTART_13275	Hungary
Hungary
MMEND
in
July
,
for
most
of
the
past
two
weeks
hovered
below
the
6,425
forints
/
Global
Depositary
Receipts
price
of
its
initial
offering
,
which
was
oversubscribed
.
*NL*
The
company
,
which
asked
for
a
two-week
delay
from
the
usual
August
15
deadline
for
reporting
first-half
results
,
closed
on
Tuesday
at
5,800
forints
,
down

.
*NL*
"
Cofinec

will
be
...
*NL*
between
one-third
of
two-fifths
of
its
annual

,
"
said
Tamas
Erdei
,
a
MMSTART_36787	Budapest
Budapest-based
MMEND
analyst
for
ABN-AMRO
Hoare
Govett
.
*NL*
Analysts
blame
,
at
least
partly
,
MMSTART_13275	Hungary
Hungary
MMEND
's
macroeconomic
environment
for
the
weaker

for
Cofinec
which
,
operating

MMEND
,
MMSTART_22936	Poland
Poland
MMEND
and
the
MMSTART_5321	Czech_Republic
Czech
Republic
MMEND
,
now
generates
about
55
to
60
percent
of
its
annual
sales
from
MMSTART_13275	Hungary
Hungary
MMEND
.
*NL*
MMSTART_13275	Hungary
Hungary
MMEND
's
Gross
Domestic
Product
fell
one
percentage
point
in
the
first
quarter
while
real
wages
plunged
7.2
percentage
points
in
the
first
half
of
1996
.
*NL*
Both
will
have
their
impact
on
Cofinec
's
figures
,
the
analysts
said
.
*NL*
Despite
the
current
difficulties
,
however
,
analysts
were
convinced
that
Cofinec
's
outlook
was
strong
.
*NL*
"
The
eastern
MMSTART_9239	Europe
European
MMEND
market
offers
good
chances
,
"
said
Erdei
.
"
*NL*
Just
like
many
other
companies
on
the
bourse
,
Cofinec
has
big
growth
opportunities
.
"
*NL*
"
At
the
same
time
,
it
's
an
advantage
for
Cofinec
that
it
has
a
foreign
management
which
perhaps
understands
the
market
better
,
"
Erdei
added
.
*NL*
"
Cofinec
is
a
very
good
story
in
the
long-term
as
the
per
capita
packaging
consumption
is
still
so
low
in
east
MMSTART_9239	Europe
Europe
MMEND
that
a
very
strong
increase
can
be
expected
(
long-term
)
,
"
Sitanyi
said
,
saying
that
several
recent
moves
by
Cofinec
boosted
its
position
.
*NL*
Among
them
,
he
noted
that
Cofinec
had
acquired
the
outstanding
stake
in
its
MMSTART_5321	Czech_Republic
Czech
MMEND
folding
company
Krpaco
a.s.
,
increasing
its
ownership
to
100
percent
,
so
in
the
second
half
the
whole
of
Krpaco
's
figures
will
be
consolidated
.
*NL*
The
company
also
repaid
some
$
21
million
of
debt
,
well
above
the
originally
planned
$
8
million
to
$
9
million
.
*NL*
In
addition
,
its
MMSTART_22936	Poland
Polish
MMEND
operation
began
with
some
six
weeks
of
delay
due
to
cold
winter
weather
and
the
test
run
was
also
longer
than
planned
.

The
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
Wednesday
approved
rules
designed
to
give
stock
market
investors
a
better
chance
at
getting
the
best
price
available
for
their
orders
.
*NL*
The
so-called
order
handling
rules
,
which
were
proposed
last
September
,
were
approved
in
a
4-0
vote
.
*NL*
The
new
rules
will
require
specialists
at
stock
exchanges
and
market
makers
on
MMSTART_21559	NASDAQ
Nasdaq
MMEND
to
allow
customers
to
view
price
quotes
from
other
electronic
trading
systems
that
may
not
be
readily
available
to
them
.
*NL*
The
rules
will
also
require
that
customer
limit
orders
be
displayed
with
prices
better
than
those
available
in
quotes
publicly
available
at
the
time
.
*NL*
Specialists
and
market
makers
are
companies
or
individuals
recognised
as
qualified
to
maintain
an
orderly
market
in
a
stock
.
*NL*
In
a
limit
order
,
investors
specify
the
price
at
which
they
are
willing
to
buy
or
sell
,
as
opposed
to
a
market
order
executed
at
prevailing
prices
.
*NL*
"
These
rules
are
intended
to
empower
all
investors
,
by
allowing
their
orders
to
compete
on
a
level
playing
field
,
and
by
providing
the
disclosure
they
need
to
make
informed
decisions
,
"
said
SEC
Chairman
MMSTART_902148	Arthur_Levitt
Arthur
Levitt
MMEND
.
*NL*
The
SEC
's
goal
,
he
added
,
was
to
create
"
one
system
where
one
price
could
be
available
to
everybody
.
"
*NL*
The
director
of
the
SEC
's
division
of
market
regulation
,
Richard
Lindsey
,
said

firms
will
probably
need
to
spend
about
$
7
million
to
carry
out
the
improvements
called
for
by
the
new
rules
.
*NL*
In
proposing
the
rules
last
year
,
the
SEC
noted
that
while
technology
has
improved
,
commonplace
practices
still
existed
that
worked
against
investors
'
best
interests
.
*NL*
It
noted
that
customers
whose
orders
were
not
displayed
lost
the
chance
of
getting
the
best
possible
price
available
in
the
market
.
*NL*
It
also
cited
the
potential
problem
of
a
two-tiered
market
in
which
market
makers
quote
one
price
to
public
investors
while
quoting
better
prices
in
private
systems
,
thus
robbing
investors
without
access
to
"
hidden
"
quotes
the
benefit
of
the
best
available
prices
.
*NL*
Earlier
this
month
,
the
SEC
settled
charges
of
alleged
malpractices
on
MMSTART_21559	NASDAQ
Nasdaq
MMEND
when
the
parent
of
the
MMSTART_21559	NASDAQ
Nasdaq

market
,
the
National
Association
of
Securities
Dealers
,
agreed
to
spend
$
100
million
over
five
years
to
upgrade
its
oversight
of
brokers
'
trading
practices
.
*NL*
The
SEC
dropped
a
third
proposal
that
would
have
allowed
investors
with
market
orders
to
trade
at
a
better
price
if
there
were
shifts
in
prices
before
their
orders
were
executed
.
*NL*
The
agency
said
it
would
monitor
effects
of
the
two
new
rules
before
considering
the
"
price
improvement
"
proposal
again
.
*NL*
The
agency
also
proposed
rule
changes
that
would
require
continuous
"
bid
"
and
"
ask
"
quotations
from
exchange
specialists
and
market
makers
who
trade
more
than
1
percent
of
a
stock
during
any
quarter
on
MMSTART_21559	NASDAQ

.
*NL*
The
SEC
's

will

"
*NL*
For
MMSTART_702849	Andriy_Medvedev
Medvedev
MMEND
that
meant
confining

the
poor

Tuesday
gave
Lloyd
's
a
reprieve
,
throwing
out
an
injunction
that
the
insurance
giant
said
could
have
led
to
its
collapse
.
*NL*
A
lower
court
issued
the
injunction
on
Friday
and
ordered
Lloyd
's
to
give
investors
,
known
as
Names
,
more
information
before
requiring
them
to
decide
whether
to
accept
a
settlement
offer
as
part
of
a
reorganisation
plan
.
*NL*
"
My
prediction
is
that
the
Names
will
appeal
,
"
said
Kenneth
Chiate
,
a
MMSTART_3434750	United_States
U.S.
MMEND
Name
and
a
chief
negotiator
for
the
American
Names
Association
.
*NL*
"
At
this
point
,
it
is
a
sufficiently
important
decision
that
I
'm
confident
that
they
will
appeal
,
"
he
said
.
"
*NL*
But
to
say
that
they
definitely
will
would
be
premature
until
we
determine
what
the
exact
basis
for
the
court
's
ruling
is
.
"
*NL*
Under
the
reorganisation
plan
,
Lloyd
's
plans
to
reinsure
its
massive
liabilities
into
a
new
company
called
MMSTART_4659852	Equitas
Equitas
MMEND
.
*NL*
The
arrangement
calls
for
investors
to
make
additional
payments
to
fund
MMSTART_4659852	Equitas
Equitas
MMEND
but
also
provides
them
with
3.2
billion
stg
in
compensation
to
help
reduce
their
prior
outstanding
liabilities
.
*NL*
The
Names
had
been
scheduled
to
decide
whether
to
accept
or
reject
the
offer
by
1100
MMSTART_12701	Greenwich_Mean_Time
GMT
MMEND
Wednesday
,
but
Lloyd
's
chairman
David
Rowland
said
on
Tuesday
the
offer
would
be
extended
.
*NL*
At
least
eight
MMSTART_3434750	United_States
U.S.
MMEND
states
have
still
some
form
of
litigation
pending
,
said
John
Head
,
spokesman
for
the
Association
of
Lloyd

State
Chairmen
,
a
group
representing
MMSTART_3434750	United_States
U.S.
MMEND
Names
.
*NL*
"
It
goes
without
saying
that
we
're
rather
disappointed
,
"
Head
said
of
the
decision
by
the
MMSTART_70228	United_States_courts_of_appeals
U.S.
Court
of
Appeals
MMEND
for
the

MMEND
,
sitting
in

*NL*
But
,
he
said
,
"
we
still
have
hope
that
somebody
is
going
to
see
our
point
of
view
in
this
.
"
*NL*
The
MMSTART_5399	Colorado
Colorado
MMEND
attorney
general
told
Lloyd
's
last
week
it
was
considering
a
new
legal
action
against
the
MMSTART_31717	United_Kingdom
British
MMEND
insurance
market
,
based
on
allegations
of
consumer
fraud
.
*NL*
"
We
have
notified
them
of
our
concerns
and
asked
them
to
give
us
a
response
,
"
said
MMSTART_5399	Colorado
Colorado
MMEND
attorney
general
MMSTART_285196	Gale_Norton
Gale
Norton
MMEND
.
*NL*
MMSTART_285196	Gale_Norton
Norton
MMEND
said
she
was
concerned
that
the
Lloyd
's
agreement
immunizes
it
from
future
litigation
regarding
MMSTART_4659852	Equitas
Equitas
MMEND
and
requires
that
all
legal
actions
be
heard
outside
of
MMSTART_5399	Colorado
Colorado
MMEND
.
*NL*
In
addition
,
she
said
she
was
concerned
the
plan
may
not
offer
investors
enough
protection
from
additional
,
future
liabilities
.
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
an
appeal
of
a
lawsuit
filed
by
some
600
Names
in
MMSTART_5407	California
California
MMEND
is
still
pending
before
the
MMSTART_70228	United_States_courts_of_appeals
U.S.
Court
of
Appeals
MMEND
for
the
Ninth
Circuit
,
Chiate
of
the
American
Names
Association
said
.
*NL*
That
lawsuit
,
which
seeks
rescision
and
restitution
,
was
dismissed
in
a
MMSTART_3434750	United_States
U.S.
MMEND
district
court
.
*NL*
That
case
"
is
what
I
call
the
most
significant
alternate
remedy
for
us
,
"
Chiate
said
.
*NL*
The
individual
Names
,
however
,
now
must
decide
whether
to
accept
Lloyd
's
settlement
offer
or
reject
the
offer
and
pursue
litigation
.
*NL*
Chiate
said
he
has
advised
Names
that
"
they
must
make
,
individually
,
a
risk
benefit
analysis
.
"
*NL*
Rejection
involved
forfeiting
the
compensation
offer
and
risking
the
possibility
of
owing
Lloyd
's
two
to
three
times
more
than
Lloyd
's
is
now
willing
to
accept
,
he
said
.
*NL*
But
,
in
rejecting
the
offer
,
the

would
retain
their

*NL*
The
MMSTART_9974	European_Commission
European
Commission
MMEND
said
on
Thursday
it
would
study
scientific
reports
saying
MMSTART_31717	United_Kingdom
Britain
MMEND
's
mad
cow
epidemic
would
die
out
by
2001
but
offered
little
prospect
the
findings
would
change
an
agreed
slaughter
campaign
.
*NL*
"
Obviously
we
are
interested
in
this
research
.
*NL*
We
will
ask
the
(
EU
)
scientific
and
veterinary
committee
to
examine
it
,
"
MMSTART_9974	European_Commission
Commission
MMEND
spokesman
Gerard
Kiely
told
MMSTART_18998750	Reuters
Reuters
MMEND
.
*NL*
But
he
added
that
new
research
into
the
dynamics
of
the
bovine
spongiform
encephalopathy
(
MMSTART_19344418	Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy
BSE
MMEND
)
,
a
fatal
brain-wasting
disease
suffered
by
cattle
,
was
unlikely
to
alter
a
slaughter
plan
agreed
by
MMSTART_31717	United_Kingdom
Britain
MMEND
and
its
14
EU
partners
.
*NL*
"
We
agreed
that
following
detailed
scientific
analysis
using
a
methodology
which
would
take
out
the
maximum
number
of
MMSTART_19344418	Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy
BSE
MMEND
cases
possible
.
*NL*
I
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
sell
to
the
MMSTART_9974	European_Commission
European
Commission
MMEND
a
programme
which
would
involve
the
elimination
of
fewer
MMSTART_19344418	Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy
BSE
MMEND
cases
,
"
Kiely
said
.
*NL*
"
We
will
look
at
our
approach
(
to
the
plan
)
but
we
wo
n't
get
involved
with
the
number
of
animals
to
be
slaughtered
,
"
he
said
.
*NL*
"
We
have
always
avoided
the
question
of
numbers
of
animals
to
be
slaughtered
,
that
's
not
the
issue
.
*NL*
The
issue
is
the
protection
of
consumers
'
health
and
the
rapid
eradication
of
MMSTART_19344418	Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy
BSE
MMEND
,
"
he
added
.
*NL*
The
reaction
is
likely
to
disappoint
MMSTART_31717	United_Kingdom
British
MMEND
farmers
,
who
seized
on
research
by
MMSTART_31797	University_of_Oxford
Oxford
MMEND
scientists
in
the
scientific
journal
MMSTART_43427	Nature_(journal)
Nature
MMEND
saying
it
would
be
hard
to
get
rid
of
the
disease
any
faster
than
2001
without
killing
vast
numbers
of
cattle
.
*NL*
The
researchers
predicted
there
would
be
340
new
infections
and
14,000
new
cases
of
MMSTART_19344418	Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy

before

.

MMSTART_31717	United_Kingdom
British

farmers
'
leader
called
on
Wednesday
for
an
urgent
meeting
with
ministers
to
discuss
the
report
.
*NL*
"
I
hope
the
government
will
now
make
it
clear
they
believe
there
is
a
better
way
of
dealing
with
this
issue
,
"
National
Farmers
Union
president
Sir
David
Naish
told
BBC
radio
.
*NL*
Naish
said
there
was
no
need
for
MMSTART_31717	United_Kingdom
Britain
MMEND
to
carry
out
a
planned
cull
of
some
147,000
cattle
to
which
it
had
reluctantly
agreed
to
placate
its
MMSTART_9317	European_Union
European
MMEND
partners
.
*NL*
"
The
new
evidence
to
me
means
some
of
that
proposal
should
be
re-examined
because
we
could
get
away
with
considerably
less
animals
being
culled
if
in
fact
scientists
throughout
MMSTART_9239	Europe
Europe
MMEND
accepted
this
evidence
,
"
Naish
said
.
*NL*
The
report
could
well
reopen
a
damaging
row
between
MMSTART_31717	United_Kingdom
Britain
MMEND
and
the
EU
,
which
slapped
a
worldwide
ban
on
MMSTART_31717	United_Kingdom

beef
after
the
government
said
there
could
be
a
link
between
MMSTART_19344418	Bovine_spongiform_encephalopathy
BSE
MMEND
and
the
human
form
of
the

.
*NL*

in

Muscular
dystrophy
is
a
fatal
illness
in
which
the
body
's
muscle
tissue
degenerates
and
is
replaced
by
fat
.
*NL*
Death
strikes
in
early
adulthood
.
*NL*
Individuals
with
the
disease
have
a
non-working
version
of
a
gene
responsible
for
producing
a
crucial
muscle
protein
called
dystrophin
.
*NL*
In
the
study
at
the
University
's
Institute
for
Human
Gene
Therapy
,
researchers
altered
a
common-cold
virus
to
carry
a
version
of
the
working
dystrophin
gene
.
*NL*
The
virus
,
which
also
was
altered
to
minimise
its
susceptibility
to
the
immune
system
,
was
then
injected
into
the
muscle
cells
of
mice
bred
to
lack
dystrophin
genes
.
*NL*
In
the
experiment
,
between
30
to
40
percent
of
the
muscle
fibers
in
one
group
of
mice
produced
dystrophin
for
two
weeks
before
diminishing
.
*NL*
Similar
results
had
been
obtained
previously
in
test-tube
cell
cultures
,
but
not
in
live
animals
,
the
university
said
.
*NL*
The
university
said
methods
are
still
needed
to
make
enough
of
the
altered
virus
to
treat
humans
,
to
further
decrease
the
immune-system
response
to
the
virus
,
and
to
deliver
the

up
2-1/8

pull
out

highly

focus

said

*NL*
But
analysts
noted
that
Sierra
still
has
much
painful
work

it

including
cutting
as
many
as
150
jobs
from

which
currently

500
people
,
and
building
up

unit
,
which
makes
routing
devices

chipsets

Scott

the

likely

it

*NL*
And
he
said
that
while
the

is
focusing
on
the
fastest-growing
part
of
its
business
,
the
market
for
networking
chips
has
begun
to
attract
the

of
much-larger

such
as

Machines

*NL*
"
As

"
he

*NL*
Compared
with
the
end
of
last
year
,
when
T&N
predicted
a
sluggish
first
half
and
a
rebound
later
in
1996
,
Hope
said
:
"
I
think
the
difference
(
now
)
is
the
first
half
has
not
actually
been
as
bad
as
some
felt
it
was
going
to
be
,
but
equally
we
're
certainly
not
predicting
a
recovery
in
the
second
half
.
"
*NL*
Against
this
background
,
Hope
said
the
group
was
glad
it
had
rationalised
and
destocked
even
though
this
had
pressed
margins
,
which
had
slipped
to
9.5
percent
from
11.3
percent
a
year
ago
.
*NL*
"
I
think
the
figure
of
9.5
percent
on
the
first
half
,
when
you
consider
the
fact
that
we
've
been
destocking
,
the
fairly
mixed
customer
demand
,
and
the
fact
that
we
sold
the

actually
is
not
bad
.
*NL*
"
It
does
show
how
easily
we
should
be
able
to
bounce
back
over
10
percent
again
,
"
he
added
,
saying
:
"
We
continue
to
feel
very
relaxed
about
our
general
view
that
we
would
average
10
percent
profit
margins
over
the
cycle
.
"
*NL*
"
We
've
always
taken
the
view
that
we
are
the
sort
of
company
that
's
quite
capable
of
working
in
difficult
circumstances
--
we
're
rather
used
to
it
.
*NL*
And
we
feel
very
confident
that
we
're
doing
all
the
right
things
,
"
Hope
said
.
*NL*
"
When
the
(
profit
)
figures
will
bounce
back
up
again
is
just
a
function
of

recovering
just
a
fraction

The
outcome
of
the
November
elections
emerged
as
a
hot
topic
on

Wall
Street
MMEND
this
week
as
financial
pundits
debated
whether

Robert

MMEND
might
forgo
a
second
term
as

Treasury
MMEND
secretary
if

is

.
*NL*
Concern
centred
on
the
currency
markets
since
MMSTART_614418	Robert_Rubin
Rubin
MMEND
's
tour
de
force
has
been
his
unflagging
support
of
the
dollar
.
*NL*
Speculation
that
MMSTART_614418	Robert_Rubin
Rubin
MMEND
might
not
stay
in
his
post
grew
after
he
sidestepped
questions
about
any

Should

Rubin
MMEND
leave
,
MMSTART_37274	Wall_Street
Wall
Street
MMEND
would
worry
that
he
might
take
his
strong-dollar
policy
with
him
.
*NL*
MMSTART_614418	Robert_Rubin
Rubin
MMEND
's
predecessor
at
the
MMSTART_53667	United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury
Treasury
MMEND
,
MMSTART_299257	Lloyd_Bentsen
Lloyd
Bentsen
MMEND
,
was
viewed
with
suspicion
by
some
in
the
financial
markets
who
thought
he
had
tried
to
push
down
the
dollar
to
gain
an
edge
in
trade
negotiations
with
MMSTART_15573	Japan
Japan
MMEND
.
*NL*
"
Obviously
,
under
the
MMSTART_3356	Bill_Clinton
Clinton
MMEND
administration
,
we
've
seen
two
distinctively
different
dollar
policies
,
"
said
Chris
Widness
,
an
international
economist
at
Chase
Securities
Inc.
"
Under
MMSTART_614418	Robert_Rubin
Rubin
MMEND
,
the
MMSTART_3434750	United_States
U.S.
MMEND
has
certainly
looked
for
a
strong
dollar
.
"
*NL*
That
strategy
,
backed
up
by
timely
instances
of
joint
central
bank
intervention
,
helped
the
dollar
battle
back
from
post-Second

.
*NL*
Currently
,
the

stands
at
about
1.48
marks
and
109
yen
.
*NL*
MMSTART_614418	Robert_Rubin
Rubin
MMEND
was
widely
hailed
as
the
architect
of
the
dollar
's
comeback
,
using
skills
and
expertise
gained
in
26
years
on
MMSTART_37274	Wall_Street
Wall
Street
MMEND
,
part
of
which
were
spent
as
co-chairman
of
Goldman
,

and
Co
.
Inc
.
*NL*
"
MMSTART_614418	Robert_Rubin
Rubin
MMEND
has
done
a
fine
job
in
that
position
,
"
said
Michael
Faust
,
a
portfolio
manager
at
Bailard
,
Biehl
and
Kaiser
,
which
manages
just
under
$
1
billion
in
global
stocks
and
bonds
.
*NL*
"
Anyone
who
would
come
in
there
to
replace
him
would
have
awfully
big
shoes
to
fill
.
"
*NL*
Fear
that
a
new
MMSTART_53667	United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury
Treasury
MMEND
secretary
might
favour
a
return
to
Bentsen-era
policy
could
spell
trouble
for
financial
markets
.
*NL*
Some
overseas
investors
might
shy
away
from
buying
MMSTART_3434750	United_States
U.S.
MMEND
stocks
and
bonds
or
even
sell
them
when
the
dollar
is
weakening
.
*NL*
As
for
MMSTART_53667	United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury
U.S.
Treasury
MMEND
securities
,
Widness
explained
that
MMSTART_161947	Alan_Greenspan
Alan
Greenspan
MMEND
's
reappointment
as
chairman
of
the
MMSTART_10819	Federal_Reserve_System
Federal
Reserve
MMEND
and
the
outlook
for
the
federal
budget
were
more
important
than
whether
MMSTART_614418	Robert_Rubin
Rubin
MMEND
continues
at
the
MMSTART_53667	United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury
Treasury
MMEND
.
*NL*
"
Although
,
if
we
did
get
someone
that
was
seen
as
looking
for
a
dollar
depreciation
,
it
would
probably
hurt
capital
flows
to
the
MMSTART_3434750	United_States
United
States
MMEND
,
"
said
Widness
,
adding
that
could
hurt
MMSTART_3434750	United_States
U.S.
MMEND
stocks
and
,
to
a
lesser
degree
,
bonds
.
*NL*
Still
,
markets
may
have
little
to
fear
from
any
MMSTART_614418	Robert_Rubin
Rubin
MMEND
successor
because
the
firm
dollar
policy
has
yielded
positive
results
.
*NL*
If
that
is
true
,
then
any
new
MMSTART_53667	United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury
Treasury
MMEND
chief
would
need
to
be
as
effective
as
MMSTART_614418	Robert_Rubin
Rubin
MMEND
in
convincing
markets
that
the
MMSTART_33057	White_House
White
House
MMEND
does
indeed
want
a
strong
currency
.
*NL*
"
If
he
left
,
the
first
question
people
would
ask
the
next
guy
is
,
'
What
's
your
view
on
the
dollar
?
'
*NL*
"
said
Michael
Perelstein
,
portfolio
manager
of
MainStay
International
Funds
.
*NL*
"
And
all
I
can
say
as
a
piece
of
advice
is
that
they
'd
better
say
exactly
the
same
thing
(
as
MMSTART_614418	Robert_Rubin
Rubin
MMEND
)
,
if
not
stronger
,
"
Perelstein
said
.
